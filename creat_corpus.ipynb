The turbine powered attachments are much more effective now, and much larger Lego creations are being accidentally sucked up.  I'm using the included muffler AND venting the exhaust outside, resulting in an extremely quiet unit.  (you could hold a normal conversation 5 feet from the unit, and hear everything just fine)  Installation was pretty painless, but I did have to rearrange some of the piping leading to the unit.  Make sure to order some extra vacuum piping while you're here, since you won't find it at any hardware stores.\\n\\nThis is actually manufactured by electrolux, and the price is excellent for what you get.  You would pay 2x to 3x as much for a similarly powered unit from a dealer.\\n\\nSome minor cons:  The 90-degree elbow that goes from the exhaust port to the muffler has to be attached to the unit with pvc cement (as opposed to some sort of friction fitting, which is how the elbow attaches to the muffler), making it more difficult to rearrange your setup at some point in the future.  While you can't attach a hose directly to the unit, the package does include a t-pipe and attachment port, although the port sits very deep in the t-pipe, and occludes a significant portion of the path through the piping.  Also, the included attachment port is only compatible with systems that use a conductive metal ring on the end of the vacuum hose.  I have an older system without the metal ring, so the attachment port was useless anyway.\"),\n",

Half of the attachments inside the lower bin were also open and the other half were wrapped in plastic bags. On powering up the unit found it way too noisy. The noise rating of this unit at 62 decibles is one of the lowest so it must be a defective unit. I returned it to eVacuumstore promptly. It took them nearly a month to process the refund and they deducted $20 towards shipping cost claiming that the returned unit was tested to be ok by their technical staff.

My husband woke up the next morning and it was perfectly done and works and looks great in our RV. I didn\\'t like the \"almond\" color face plate, so I spray painted it bronze so it would look better and match our camper decor. You would think the entire setup came with the RV. As long as you follow the directions and the dimensions in the instructions, it\\'s a breeze!\\n\\nThe amount of suction that this unit produces blows away my Shop•Vac brand vacuum! Watch your fingers on the hose when you plug it in. If you do like I did and test it on your hand (don\\'t we all do that?) when you first plug it in, the suction shrinks up the hose and can pinch your fingers. The first things I used this on was a vacuum storage bag with a pillow and some sheets in it. I wanted to compare how fast and how much air it would take out compared to the Shop•Vac, and the difference isn\\'t even comparable. This was done in less than 10 seconds, AND it took out more air!\\n\\nAfter the install, I had a bit of a mess to clean up inside the cabinets and on the carpet and hard floor, and this just sucked it right up with no problem. I used the included Rug Rat \"power\" brush, and it was fantastic. Fluffed up the carpets and took all the wood splinters and dust away. The attachment doesn\\'t actually have power going to it, but the strong force of the suction makes the brush spin and it is very effective.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to install this in your RV but have been ambivalent about the install and the effectiveness, I\\'m sure you won\\'t be disappointed if you buy it! Also, I bought the Automatic Dustpan floor accessory and didn\\'t even install it. You don\\'t need to with this. Why store a broom in your RV when you have this beast that includes bare floor attachments? It\\'s overkill.\\n\\nTIP: Make sure you feed the wire that attached to the face plate through both the inner bracket and the hole BEFORE you attach the wire to the face plate itself! It does sort of warn you in the instructions when to attach the wire, but it fails to remind you to feed it through first!'),\n",

       "  \"We own a 32 foot Winnebago Vista and have three kids.  When we go camping, we get a lot of dirt into the RV.  I decided to try this Dirt Devil to get relief from the sweeping and the hand vacuuming we had to do.  I watched some videos on how to install it and saw all the positive reviews about it.\\n\\nI'm not a mechanic or a particularly talented handyman so it had to be simple to install.  To my great relieve, it was very simple.  I install my unit under a bench seat in the dining area, laying horizontal, cut a hole for the attachment and another hole as a vent. I was very surprised on how powerful the unit is.\\n\\nUsing the vacuum is simple.  Plug in the hose and attach what nozzle you want to use.  The expandable hose will reach the entire interior of the motorhome with no problem.  It works equally well on the linoleum and the rug.\\n\\nThe only drawback I have found so far, is that the main hose has some pullback when you start to pull it out to it's longer lengths.  It feels as if it is trying to pull away from you.  But that is a minor issue compared to how well it works.\"),\n",

These are fine, high quality units that will give you many years of trouble free service. Just remember to change your bag and locate the unit where it can get a good supply of fresh incoming air as it moves a large amount of air as it operates. These work great under the dinette seats in RV's I recommend installing a vent grille from a RV heating system or a marine type louvered grille for the air intake. As far as colors of inlet valves as mentioned, they are available in many colors. You can also connect a VacPan which really makes a nice addition to an RV.

Generally speaking I'm extremely happy with the central unit.  I installed it on a 3500 sq. ft. house.  Here are my thoughts about the system.\\n\\n1.  The central unit is much, much quieter than the old Filtrex unit it replaced.\\n\\n2.  The central unit comes with a muffler on the exhaust.  The exhaust needs to be vented to the outside especially if the unit is located in the basement or other living areas.  Prior to purchasing the system be sure you have a plan to route the exhaust piping to the outside.\\n\\n3.  The instructions to install the central unit are only average.  The central comes with two suction ports that can used to pipe to different areas of the house.  The second port can be capped if it is not needed.  There also is a third port directly on the unit where the vacuum hose can be connected.  The instructions do not mention anything about these ports.  Remember vacuum pipe different than the pipe you can get at a home center.  You'll need to purchase some online or at a local vacuum store.\\n\\n4  The attachments are average.  The hose is very light.  The electric head has six carpet heights.  If you don't have the correct height selected, the beater brushes will pull the head across the carpet.  If that happens, select a higher carpet height on the head unit.\\n\\n5.  There is a switch at the top of the hose, Off, I, II.  There are no instructions on what I or II means.  Each turns on the central unit without any noticeable sound or suction difference.\\n\\n6.  The aluminum tube permanently connects to the electric head.  A second tube is needed and not provided to connect to the hardwood floor attachment.  The hardwood floor attachment does swivel.  I can't review it since I haven't purchased another tube.\\n\\nAll in all I would have purchased this again now knowing the systems flaws.  It was delivered missing a few of the attachments.  I did email the supplier who quickly shipped the attachments.  I also emailed the supplier about some installation details.  Again they were very responsive and helpful.\"),\n",

       "  'We have not owned a central vacuum system before, so this is our first. Our house is a two story, 3400 square feet with 3 outlets on each floor. I installed this system because I discovered our house was built with the room outlets for central-vac pre-installed. Also, my wife has allergies so I figured exhausting all the dust to the outside instead of relying on filters in vacuum cleaners to remove it all was a better idea. She also has back trouble so I was looking for a way to lighten the load of hauling a conventional vac around the house - especially up the stairs.\\n\\nAll the pipes and wires for the system were installed and dropped into the crawl space, so most of the hard work was done by the builder (our house is 10 years old and we bought it 2 years ago).  I had to run the main trunk line in the crawl space and connect all the outlets into it, then hook up the wiring. I installed the vacuum unit in our 3-car garage right beside the back door. The whole project took about 5 hours.\\n\\nOne strange thing I found with central vacs is that the 2\" PVC piping is quite hard to find. The big box stores don\\'t stock it, although they do stock some of the elbows and tees. I had to do a lot of surfing to find 8 foot long vacuum piping. I didn\\'t try to use common schedule 40 PVC piping (which you can find anywhere) because several sites advised against it (vacuum pipe is schedule 20).\\n\\nMy wife absolutely loves this system. The hose and vacuum head are much easier to work with than a conventional vacuum cleaner. The vacuum suction is real strong and it does a great job on everything. It\\'s a very different experience with how quiet it is compared to a regular vacuum cleaner. Our downstairs is about 75% hardwood and 25% carpet. Upstairs is all carpet. This systems works very well on both. We\\'re very pleased with it and we\\'d recommend it to anyone. We have two small dogs and conventional vacs always had that \"dog\" smell in them. This system puts everything to the outdoors (well, to the garage anyway), so we don\\'t have the dog dandruff smell anymore. All-in-all, I can\\'t say enough about this system. I\\'d have installed this years ago if I\\'d only known how nice it is.\\n\\nOne note: These systems commonly have a \"sweep\" outlet in the kitchen. Ours was plumbed for it, but I didn\\'t install that. We just never use a broom in the kitchen. We vacuum instead.\\n\\nI\\'ve been advised by a friend who\\'s had central vacs for many years that the main weakness in these systems in general is the motor. This product has a 10-year warranty on the motor, which is pretty good compared to some others, so I\\'m going to make sure I keep the proper paperwork for that.'),\n",

       "  \"Amazing does not even begin to describe this. This does way more than just vacuum. (See photos)\\n\\nThis is a complete home cleaning system like you've never experienced before. Having everything that's being vacuumed immediately after it leaves the hose that sucks it up dumped it into a vat of water is positively genius. Dust is tough, If not impossible to contain unless you put it in a vat of water.\\n\\nI agree with the reviews were they tell you to buy it directly from a rainbow home demo/ authorized dealer. Rainbow should hook up with Amazon so that they can sell them through Amazon as well. Then you get the best of both worlds.\\n\\nThis is positively the best clean my home has ever received.\\n\\nThe review that complains about all the gross stuff that comes out of  your house when you use this vacuum is worded very negatively and is a terrible representation of what this cleaning system does.  It makes it sound like it's a bad thing. I would much rather that pile of nastiness be somewhere designated outside like in the garden or just in a trash bag until the water dissipates then in my home. As soon as I got this I vacuumed everything in my house… walls anything that collects dust hanging on the walls etc.\\n\\nThis is the best thing that has ever happened to me & my home.\\n\\nNot only does this the Rainbow clean your home, but it is also an air purifier that is designed to run 24/7 and take existing dust and dirt floating in the air out of your home environment. You can also add essential oils in order to not only clean the air but freshening it to make it smell good as well.\\n\\nWell worth the investment. What you spend over the years buying and replacing vacuums and filters ( or time spent cleaning filters) will equal out to be what you spend all at one time on a Rainbow.\\n\\nWhen you look at the photos… Gross gross & gross! :(.  Let me just add that I am a very clean…OCD clean person. I regularly clean walls and thoroughly and frequently. I also clean baseboards and floors. This system still somehow managed to get all of this nastiness out of one small room.\"),\n",

Be prepared for you back to hurt after lifting it so many times.\\n\\n- The way it\\'s designed it\\'s like dragging an uncooperative small child around. I\\'ve dinged up furniture, molding and sides of doors trying to go from room to room. Also, have fun with the stairs. While it\\'s at the top you\\'re praying it won\\'t all of a sudden come rolling down and take you out while trying to reach the middle stairs.\\n\\n- Not intended for a quick clean. You have to fill the bowl up with water and MUST empty it when your done. Otherwise there\\'s the mildew.\\n\\n- Where to dispose of the... results? At the end you have a bowl filled with a combination of mud, pet hair and god-knows what else. It is suggested either to throw it outside or down the toilet. I don\\'t feel like risking my plumbing, so outside I have a nasty pile of what appears to be part of a werewolf. And god forbid you ever accidentally spill a dirty bowl.\\n\\n- The \"warranty\". So yes, please by from a licensed distributor to ensure you get the actual Rainbow warranty. But apparently it doesn\\'t cover regular maintenance cleanings or fixing the hose which had gotten wedged under a car tire. I had to pay out-of-pocket for that.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it\\'s great if you like taking the time to do a deep cleaning and don\\'t mind regularly cleaning the bowl. But if you just want a quick vacuum, you better have a different one. I also wish the design was different. There\\'s a reason why this style went out. Maybe if they had it in a smaller back pack version, like some commercial vacuums. I miss my old vacuum where the cord would wind up automatically and was 1/20th the price.'),\n",

The disgustingness of the water only illustrates the incompetence of other vacuums.  Literally vacuumed a 5x7 rug and the dog hair and dirt it sucked out made the water black, so I emptied and rinsed the tub.  Did another rug and did the same.  Did a carpeted living room and them emptied.  Granted I changed the water probably more than needed, but still, what I picked up in just these three small areas would have been enough to fill a regular vacuum bag.  We have only lived in this house for 4 months and have vacuumed with a regular vacuum a few times.

No beater bar so I can run right over my floors after cleaning the entryway rug. I like the way the brushes sweep the dirt in toward the vacuum head and its power driven. This newer model does follow better and rolls easier than the old model I had. Suction is great and the redesigned water bowl is MUCH easier to clean. Having lots of pets & living in the country with the dust pollen etc it cleans great. I do empty outside and rinse with water hose before bringing it inside. I then wipe it good, refill & leave out. The biggest reason for this purchase was that since it also cleans the air (on hi a bit noisy), it can always be ready to use. I work plus have a business and have a crew of critters which have to be tended to in the evenings after work. Doesn't give me much evening time to vac daily. Hubby no longer drives and is home so I am hoping he will run it every other day for me ?.\\n\\nI had my old Rainbow 15+ years and it was used when I got it! It still worked great and was my favorite. We also had an upright that hubby said he would use if I bought. The distributor was offering $300 for any brand of old vacuums if purchasing that day (at home demo), $350 if a Rainbow. I gave him both vacs and got my new for about the same price as this offer.

I did have to return one, but had no problems getting a replacement and that one works like a champ.  I am happy with this vac and! I get a replacement filter extra.  I have a bit of over planning and always try to keep extra filters and things so awesome bonus!  The cord is long enough to get into the farthest reaches and with the extra hose attachment I got into places I hadn't in years.  Everything even fits into the bag, even the extra pieces so everything is tidy and neat.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and think it will last for a long time.\"),\n",

       "  'The wet/dry vacuum is so handy to keep in the boat, car or camping equipment.  It stores into a medium size bag to carry around.  Since it will clean up either wet or dry it does not matter what spills, just grab it and clean it up.  It has tools to get into those tiny crevices that food seem to find to easily.  The cord is over 16 feet long so you have ample cord in most cases.  It has a filter for those with allergies to dust, just wash it occasionally to clean.  The suction with this is excellent, it picks up with no problem.  Leaves the car seats and mats looking great.

       "  'Hotor Car Vacuum Cleaner is great to keep in the car with you, especially if you have young kids! This vacuum is a \"dust buster\" for those who are familiar with it. Therefore, it does not have the same powerful suction as an actual vacuum cleaner. That being said, it can clean up your vehicle well. The power cord is long enough to easily reach every inch of my Dodge Grand Caravan minivan. If you do have difficulty reaching there is an extension hose you can connect. The vacuum comes with two different adapter tips to help clean in hard to reach areas. My favorite adapter is the brush, because it can pick up more than the suction alone. When you are finished using the vacuum you can press the button on top that releases the large end piece with the filter. Pull the filter out and you are able to discard the contents. Since this comes with a carrying case you can keep everything together and in your vehicle.\\n\\nOverall, it performs as advertised and I am pleased with it\\'s cleaning ability. I do wish there was more suction to clean more quickly and to remove pet hair easier. The suction alone hasn\\'t been able to remove my dog\\'s hair in the upholstery. When I add the brush attachment the brush pulls the hair out of the upholstery, but it remains in the bristles. Thanks for watching!\\n\\nGiven sample to test and return my personal honest opinion. I create videos to demonstrate that I have tested the product and have made no false statements.'),\n",

But having it plug into the cigarette lighter receptacle will work perfect for when we go on vacation or road trips since our backseat gets so messy with children.

This seems to get the biggest part of the job done, but it isn't what you'd need for fine cleaning.\\n\\nAccessories: 3/5\\n\\nThe accessories are cheaply made, but work decently with proper use. The hose extension broke when I let my 4 year old try to vacuum the car though. The brush attachment is nice and necessary if you'd like to get any bit of hair out of the car, but it only goes so far when the motor on the vacuum doesn't suck very much.\\n\\nFunction: 3/5\\n\\nThe design of this has 2 major flaws.\\n\\n1. The motor is NOT very powerful. It provides light suction but will not pick up small leaves, small twigs or anything other than light dirty and  maybe some cracker crumbs.\\n\\n2. The dirt canister has no way to keep the debris INSIDE. There's no flap or suction mechanism, it's just open and the idea is that the dirt will settle around the sides. This doesn't work once there's any amount of stuff inside of it and you have to empty is very frequently in order to keep from making a mess as you're cleaning one. HOWEVER, this does not overheat like other vacuums, it didn't even get warm.\\n\\nValue: 2/5\\n\\nRight now it's listed at $35.00. For that price, you can easily pick up a Black and Decker. We got a Shark petperfect II refurbished for that price and it lasted for 2 years before the battery quit charging on us.\\n\\nHonorable Mentions:\\n\\n- Bag: The carrying bag really is convenient and keeps all the attachments from getting lost. I think more brands should adopt a similar accessory.\\n\\n- 12v power option. It would be nice if more handheld vacuums had this or included it as an option because it's very inconvenient to run an extension cord out to the car or to be using a cordless vac and have it die before you're finished.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nI wouldn't purchase this again. I know there's a lot of brands of the exact same vacuum floating around and their brand stamped on the front of it, but the design of it lets you know they're the same vacuum. For us, we need something with a better design and more power to get our car clean, not just slightly less dirty.\"),\n",

It picked up small papers and pebbles and the finest dirt.\\n\\nRemember it is a handheld so it does not have a huge dirt holder so if you have a really messy vehicle you will be needing to empty it quite a bit but it is totally worth it. It comes with two attachments, the longer hose adapter and piece that slides into it for pick up and the scrubber adapter.\\n\\nI love the storage bag to, now i can keep this in the back of my vehicle without it looking like an eyesore and i will always have it handy and ready to use in case of accidents.\\n\\nI have not tried sucking up anything wet with it yet, because thankfully there have been no spills, but i can honestly say it is worth it to have just for the dry pickup alone!\\n\\nI definitely recommend this to everyone, especially mothers, kids tend to track the worst mess into vehicles.

       "  'I have a fairly new car and unlike my old heavily used mini-van, this one can continue to look new as long as I take good care of it. I like to use the car wash vacuums because they have such good suction. But in between visits, this is fairly good for quick touch ups. I really like the crevice tool because it gets in between the seats especially on the sides of the driver and passenger seats where all kinds of things fall down.\\n\\nThe suction is moderate and it has a harder time getting things like dry grass out of the carpet. It is no comparison to a car wash vacuum but it does what you would think for a smaller hand-held. It runs off your car battery (convenient) and has a couple of attachments, an easy to clean collection area and a carry bag for all the parts. Sample provided for review.'),\n",

       "  \"I like this mini vacuum. It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\\n\\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\\n\\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\\n\\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\\n\\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\\n\\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\\n\\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.\\n\\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.\"),\n",

I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality level of all aspects of the little portable vacuum.\\n\\nIt plugs into the car cigarette lighter. After 15-20 minutes of being on continuously, the motor was not hot, actually...no heat at all....and THAT is surprising! All parts and attachments assemble together very easy, and all attachments STAY together even during vigorous usage.\\n\\nThe small brush easily gets between the seat and door posts where there’s not much room, even for a hand. It picked up everything off the carpet and off the floor mats. It has a brush attachment that really works, and a crevice tool attachment that works well in the seat crevices. It also has a hose attachment which works well and appears to be very durable.\\n\\nThe front stays secured during usage and easily detaches for emptying the dirt out and then is easily re-attachable after emptying.

Yes, I am yet another reviewer who received this car vac for free from the seller because they needed folks to test this out and review it.  I agreed to test it but I was very skeptical.\\n\\nHere's the thing.  My car is a dog car.  Make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  They aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  When I bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  So, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac I just was not optimistic.\\n\\nIt did a GOOD job.  The suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  But when I was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  This picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  It struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  I used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  By the time I was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  I am impressed.  It could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  And the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  I am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  You wont have that problem with this vacuum\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  Is this the best vacuum I've ever used?  No, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  And it really does a very good job cleaning.  So small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.

      "this product really sucks, i could't resist the juvenile pun. recently installed one of these as a replacement for an older vac unit that bit the dust. 4,000 square foot home with 5 inlets. works great. plenty of suction power, easy to install and easy to empty. great price too. two thumbs up for a mid range central vac unit.\n",
      "here's the problem - i ordered this system to replace an existing unit that was old and had worn out. the first unit i received didn't even power up. amazon's great and shipped a replacement asap.the replacement worked great . for a while. about a month ago (after only 9 months of service) the unit began just shutting down in the middle of vacuuming usually after 2-3 minutes of use. required a hard reset - as in unplug and replug in. since it's in a corner of the basement, that's a little inconvenient, amazon says the return period is over and i have to contact the manufacturer. so i call honeywell and they refer me to company xxx for warranty service in my area. company xxx says \"sorry, can't help you. call company yyy\". company yyy says \"sorry, we can't help you either and not really sure who can.\". so i ask you, what good is a 5 year warranty if you can\"t get a defective unit serviced or replaced??,, am i really going to have to buy another cvac system??\n",
      "this machine can really suck the dirt and dust out of places our uprights have missed for 17 years.  and, it is super quiet, even when you are standing next to it.  unlike some of the other reviewers, my box and contents were intact. i got a users manual, a \"t\" fitting and a utility port to install for the garage. the muffler, and the all fittings to attach it.  my house had all the piping and wiring installed when it was built, so all i need to do was buy some pipe and a couple of elbows to connect it.  one thing i found out from the company that supplied the pipe is that the inlet port can be twisted off, and switched to the opposite side.  that's not in the user's manual, but it should be.  it can save some awkwardness in the final connection for some spaces.  if you don't have a central vacuum, you should plan for one in your future.  they are awesome,\n",
      "this vacuum is a great value.  excellent suction rated for up to an 8,000 square foot house.  i selected this unit because of it's power and the excellent price.  once installed i was amazed at how much more suction we got out of this unit compared the the nutone unit that it replaced.  highly recommended.\n",
      "i replaced a unit that was installed in 1975. the new unit is smaller than the old one and is doing very good job. the white color is appealing and the clean out method is superior to the old unit.\n",
      "wasted more than $400 on this loser. if you are lucky enough to get one of these which works properly then you will be delighted as i was. for three months. but when the little jewel died a horrible death i discovered that:1. the distributor supports it for 30 days. after that you must go to the manufacturer who.2, has a system of repair facilities who don't know they are supposed to fix these things. sometimes they just never return your first phone call. then.3. when you get invest $40 in packing the junker up to send it to eden, north carolina it comes back still busted so you.4. call the manufacturer who promises you a resolution by monday. they just didn't say which monday. still waiting for that one. so i.5. contacted amazon for their super-duper a-z support - turns out you are up a creek if your stuff doesn't crap out in 14 days. so.6, i'm off to by a hoover unit. from somebodyelse.com\n",
      "the motor on this burnt out almost exactly a year after purchase. both seller & manufacturer support was geared towards not spending a nickle to get it fixed. bad choice,,oh and the 'real' manufacturer isn't honeywell.\n",
      "thought negative reviews were to few to be concerned,after the first emptying of canister it now need to be unplugged and repluged in after 5 minutes of use what trash, the original unit lasted 28 years no problem  newtone\n",
      "super vacuum with lots of suction and very quiet.  aaaaaa  .  would recomend to anyone whom wants quality at a reasinable price.\n",
      "excellent suction.  replaced an old (dead) vacumaid and the difference in power is clear.  the turbine powered attachments are much more effective now, and much larger lego creations are being accidentally sucked up.  i'm using the included muffler and venting the exhaust outside, resulting in an extremely quiet unit.  (you could hold a normal conversation 5 feet from the unit, and hear everything just fine)  installation was pretty painless, but i did have to rearrange some of the piping leading to the unit.  make sure to order some extra vacuum piping while you're here, since you won't find it at any hardware stores.this is actually manufactured by electrolux, and the price is excellent for what you get.  you would pay 2x to 3x as much for a similarly powered unit from a dealer.some minor cons:  the 90-degree elbow that goes from the exhaust port to the muffler has to be attached to the unit with pvc cement (as opposed to some sort of friction fitting, which is how the elbow attaches to the muffler), making it more difficult to rearrange your setup at some point in the future.  while you can't attach a hose directly to the unit, the package does include a t-pipe and attachment port, although the port sits very deep in the t-pipe, and occludes a significant portion of the path through the piping.  also, the included attachment port is only compatible with systems that use a conductive metal ring on the end of the vacuum hose.  i have an older system without the metal ring, so the attachment port was useless anyway.\n",
      "i purchased this product from evacuumstore.com on 2/2/16 and installed it a week later replacing my 30 year old nutone central vacuum system.  the honeywell unit stopped working last week but will run for 5 minutes if you unplug, and plug it back in. today (4/23/16) i contacted evacuumstore.com i was told that most likely it's a motor or control board and would have to be fixed and to find someone local.  less than 3 months, total piece of crap.\n",
      "after 2 years the unit runs for a few minutes then shuts down and requires reset. i'm going to call honeywell, again, to see what the 5 year warranty means. i'm not optimistic. but i would not buy this unit. the last one i had, can't remember the brand, lasted 13 years until a lightening strike destroyed it.  never had a problem with it.\n",
      "don't buy this unit.  i purchased this as a replacement power unit, but after only  year of use it began to shut off within 2 minutes of startup, which requires unplugging the unit located in the garage. a huge hassle.  i got very limited use out of this unit and would never buy another honeywell central vacuume power unit.\n",
      "great product and a great price. i am really glad i chose the higher end model for only a few dollars more. it has excellent suction and is not nearly as loud as i had expected for a non externally exhausted unit. easy to install\n",
      "works great.  has plenty of suction and is pretty quiet too.  it was also much cheaper than our local retailer's quote.\n",
      "bought this in august, 2015 and installed it in my new construction house. all wires were tested out last year. now, walls closed, it would just run for a second and turn itself off. called the seller, it is over 30 days. called the manufacturer(electrolux/beam), they blamed on me as a diy. if your product is not intended for self-installation, please say so in your product ads. in their mouth, the central vacuum seems sophisticated as rocket science. they kicked me between their \"servicers\", none of whom want to fix the problem. i can not believe a manufacturer like this can exist. their 5-year warranty is nothing.\n",
      "didn't know what to expect from this product. read a few reviews and all were favorable. i already had a central vacuum unit but it burned out after approximately 40 years of regular use. installation was simple although they includes some items that had no description with them. this unit is quiet and powerful and works very well. i am very satisfied.\n",
      "great unit at a fair price. i was able to install (replace the existing unit) in about 15 min. my only gripe is that it comes with an outlet that according to the pictures should install on the front of the unit (so you can plug directly into it) but there's no spot for it or instructions on how to do it. it wasn't a deal-breaker, but i would love the option as my unit is in the garage and it would be great to be able to plug into it.\n",
      "i decided to go with a non nutone unit in a new house.  i liked the look of this and wanted to also try a permanent filter vs. removable bags.  i'm very happy with this unit.  lot of power for a 2700 sq ft home with long pipe runs, and actually pretty quiet compared to my nutone vx550 past unit, both with mufflers.  nice metal body and look to this on the wall.  can't really tell how full the container is on bottom, since it gets fogged up with dust, that would be only comment.\n",
      "right out of the box it would shut off within minutes. it seems to run very hot and shut off. very quiet which is a big plus. sent it back.\n",
      "saved a bundle going with this instead of the central vac installer's options. coupled with the honeywell h300 hose and head unit this is a great set. since this is also made by electrolux it's great knowing much of the parts are interchangeable and you get the quality without the cost.  ours is in the garage where noise wouldn't be an issue, but it's actually fairly quiet anyhow.\n",
      "i replaced my old electrolux central vacuum system with honeywell h703 model. some pvc connection changes were made. connected the inlet pipes and outlet muffler with my existing pipes. h703 works well with good suction for dirt. i was quoted over $1,200 to replace with new one but i am happy with my choice. as specified, it covers 7000 sqft and i only have 3500 sqft so hopefully it will do the job. just bought it so don't know any cons. i am planning to add dustpan in the kitchen and will connect to existing pipes/wiring.  if anyone has any other experience, please share.\n",
      "this unit replaced a 20 year old eureka cv900 ( the impeller collapsed) and so far i'm impressed.  suction is substantially better than the eureka and nowhere near as noisy. time will tell if the all plastic construction and motor/impeller quality matches that of the all steel eureka.\n",
      "for the price this is the best vacuum you can buy i used this vacuum on a commercial level at my collision repair shopwe vacuum and clean approximately 10 cars a day with three detailers and i just replaced it after five years  a great unit. hopefully most of the components are american-made\n",
      "amazing,  the dust in the house has dropped dramatically with this system moving all the airflow to the garage.  very powerful.  we coupled it with the honeywell h300 powerhead and could not be more pleased.\n",
      "wow, this thing is amazing.  i have a house with 6 wall plates and this thing could still suck the paint off your walls,  i see a few complaints about it being loud, but i don't think it is loud at all.  i have it set up with the muffler attached just like the picture and have zero complaints.  would highly recommend,,,\n",
      "i was amaze how easy it was to change out my old unit ( different brand) and connect the honeywell up,no piping changes needed.the next was how quite it ran,the sucking power.i would recommend this unit to any one.\n",
      "just installed my new honeywell 4b-h703 central vac power unit. seems solidly built. installation was simple. works great, much more powerful than the unit it replaced (hayden supervac 3600).\n",
      "very good price for this power unit. has plenty of suction and runs fairly quiet. if replacing another central vac, i recommend also  using the honeywell standard valves with this unit.\n",
      "this is a very powerful unit.  i am very, very pleased with it.  very easy to install.  i expect years of service.\n",
      "works as as advertised.  easy to empty, although my wife finds the latches difficult for her hand strength.  installed in existing location in about 30 minutes.  not as loud as the 20 year old unit it replaced.i believe this vacuum was sold to me as new but was a returned item.  everything was there, the box was obviously resealed and the accessories were loose in the bottom of the box.  the unit itself was clean and did not appear to have ever been used or installed.  if it had been the last one on the shelf at lowes and i needed it i probably would have bought it.\n",
      "slightly underpowered, but acceptable\n",
      "teriffic, it realy sucks.\n",
      "this may be a great vacuum but the package was sent cut in pieces on the box. it was obvious it had been sent back before. not like amazon to work with a distributor of this low quality. everything was broke and loosely packed.\n",
      "get one,  then vacuum with your old sucker followed by this one. it pulled 10 gallons of dirt and dust out of my 2500 sq foot house after i vacuumed with my kirby.\n",
      "great power and outstanding suction.  easy to install, nice detailed instructions included.  nice and quiet.  sleek design with easy to remove bucket.\n",
      "installed mine in 2013.  2 motors burned out so far.  im deciding if i should try one more motor replacement or have the whole unit replaced.\n",
      "replaced the hoover with this, installation with minor pipe reconfiguration. works better than the unit it replaced.\n",
      "very powerful vacuum. the filter is great and it's actually not very loud. highly recommend.\n",
      "a little smaller than some units we've owned but it definitely has great suction. we bought the honeywell h300 central vacuum elite electric hose kit to go with it and they are a great pair. it may well be quieter than most of the others we've had but that's probably subjective.\n",
      "good suction. installed 1 fifty foot hide a hose and one kick plate on the 2nd floor. 1 fifty foot hide a hose and two kick plates on the first floor. system has good suction at all use age points. total square footage of home 3000. also installed a outlet in the garage to vacuum the cars.\n",
      "very powerfully and we'll build unit, really like it.\n",
      "very powerful for 2650 square foot with 5 inlets.\n",
      "it has worked great for us so far.  no problems.\n",
      "this was one of the best investments in saved time and better house cleaning.  it is powerful and does a much better job than portable vacuums.well worth the expense and time spent on installation.\n",
      "arrived on time and worked great\n",
      "i love it, works well, 5 stars,\n",
      "works great.  very nice.\n",
      "awesome machine\n",
      "i have yet to see whether the small canister will be a problem.  it is quiet and powerful and easy to install.  if you need extra vacuum piping, buy some from your local electrolux store.\n",
      "?\n",
      "works great, arrived so quickly after ordering. love it.\n",
      "bought directly from evacuumstore.com. power unit arrived as loosely packed inside the box without any cover. half of the attachments inside the lower bin were also open and the other half were wrapped in plastic bags. on powering up the unit found it way too noisy. the noise rating of this unit at 62 decibles is one of the lowest so it must be a defective unit. i returned it to evacuumstore promptly. it took them nearly a month to process the refund and they deducted $20 towards shipping cost claiming that the returned unit was tested to be ok by their technical staff. the customer service folks maintained that the unit was shipped directly from manufacturing plant but that can not be true. the main unit itself was without any cover inside the box and half the items were open. not a good experience buying from this vendor.\n",
      "can't figure why reviews on this vac unit aren't more plentiful online. installed the unit myself in my 60 year old home which didn't have one previously. excellent suction. no more loud upright, hot exhaust in the house, or lugging around bulky canister.  best thing of all is knowing 100% of dust is being filtered outside the house. most vacuum companies tout suction which is only as good as the filtration. it involved some time and effort running the pvc from inlet to unit but it was well worth it. very happy so far,\n",
      "first central vac i have owned so my opinion may not count a lot. the price was right and the unit runs very quiet and has plenty of suction. it mounted easily in just a few minutes.\n",
      "we were replacing a 35 year old unit that is no longer in business, and i looked at several units, but thought this one would work for us.  it was pretty easy to install with just a little change in the original plumbing.  the thing i noticed is how quite this unit is compared to the old one.  our central vac unit is in a stairwell closet that is next to my ham radio room.  when the old unit was being used, i could not use my radios for the noise.  when this honeywell unit is in use, i can barely hear it and it doesn't bother me at all.\n",
      "not crazy about the suction release valve.  i always check the pressure with my hand and that causes the valve to pop. you have to shut the vac off to reset it.\n",
      "mine seems to have come with a motor that is burning out. problem started within months of purchase. it is covered by warrantee, but it will be $120 per visit by a technician - once to diagnose it and a second time to replace the motor. so my expense will be $240 in labor minimum or a trip to take in the unit at the nearest authorized repair place 40 miles from my home.\n",
      "i purchased one of these units in october 2014 and 6 months later the motor burned out.  it is under a 5 year warranty so i paid the postage ($60) to send it back to the manufacturer for repair or replacement.  they repaired it and sent it back.  that was in the summer of 2015.  today the motor burned out again, a little over a year after the repair.  i did nothing that would cause this problem either time.  the vacuum is not used often or heavily so it should not be worn out. there are still 3 years on the warranty, but i am going to throw it out this time and buy another brand to replace it.  my advice is that if you are thinking of purchasing this central vacuum unit you should save yourself some grief and buy another brand instead.\n",
      "ordered this in hopes of replacing the central vac in our condo that went out a few years ago. my grandmother is elderly and has had a hard time with a regular vacuum. well, this has been a headache. the vacuum did not work for us, and when it did, the suction was very low. the seller has not been helpful, giving us the run around about returning the item. i would not recommend buying this item or from this seller.\n",
      "replaced old unit works great easy install. .\n",
      "awesome product i used to vacuum every day likely my house was already pre-made for the central vac to be install everything's been working great as far as the smell just put a bounty sheet over the exhaust hole for the little rubber band on it and as you turn it on all you would be smelling is the bounty sheet\n",
      "works greaaat\n",
      "great machine, lots of power much quieter then my old central vac\n",
      "customer service was excellent, we are happy with this product. it was a replacement for an old existing unit that burnt out. we did not think, however, to try and match the inlet/outlet holes to our old unit- so we had to run new pipe. it takes special vac pipe, which they don't carry at our local lowes or home depot. but that's not the fault of the product or seller. happy with our new honeywell,\n",
      "very easy to install. the unit is so quiet i didn't think it was running until i heard the suction from the inlet i opened. the suction is very powerful. we have been vacuuming hemlock needles off our stairwell carpet for 30 years and i was very impressed how fast they came up. time will tell how well this unit holds up but i have no reason to believe that this vacuum will give us many years of service.\n",
      "it is the perfect replacement for the old fasco. installation was very easy and suction is stronger than expected. couldn't be more pleased and what a savings over local stores,,\n",
      "excellent ,\n",
      "love it, my husband installed it in our new home. definitely easier with new construction.\n",
      "so much quieter and smaller than the old one.  wish i'd replaced it much earlier.\n",
      "bought this for my mom in her 1000 sg ft condo. works great, very nice unit.\n",
      "finally got around to installing this. my wife loves it. works great.\n",
      "i installed this in my house about a year ago. still working great.\n",
      "was thinking the dust container wa bigger, but will be fine\n",
      "perfect suction, this works better than my original vac.\n",
      "works great, super suction and easy to install.\n",
      "powerful suction, but not too loud. i love it,\n",
      "great value. excellent power and quiet.\n",
      "easy to install and works great.\n",
      "i's good as hayden that i had.\n",
      "this thing rocks,\n",
      "still have not been able to use my vacuum.  after coming in late by a few weeks and after a few phone calls and having to file a complaint with amazon to get the ball rolling, the vacuum has a broken part.  after several more phone calls and emails they finally sent a part but it was not the correct part.  still waiting on the correct part.  credit card was charged on december 18 so evacuum store has their money, but i still don't have a vacuum.  looks like a good unit but i don't know how it works yet.  i would never recommend ordering from evacuum store via amazon.  everytime i call and give my order number i get the reaction of \"oh is this an amazon order\"  don't sell on amazon if you don't want to deal with the customers after.\n",
      "just installed this unit.  so far it is great, easy to install. no vacuum outlet on unit.\n",
      "great product. has more suction than the unit i replaced. would recommend to anyone for new installation or replacement.\n",
      "the honeywell central vacuum works very well but runs extremely hot. i would like someone from amazon or honeywell to contact me and possibly exchange it. i had a local service look at it and he thinks it is safe buy noted how hot it gets.\n",
      "works well.  installs easily. great support from dealer\n",
      "it is working fine now\n",
      "would rate it as a five better than hover more suction\n",
      "suction is weak\n",
      "it is very quiet and has great suction\n",
      "i did much research on these units and took a chance on the all-inclusive one as opposed to buying the power unit and attachments separately. it arrived and since my house was plumbed for the vacuum, i had it hung and running within 15 minutes. not plumbed from the stub to the unit though. that required a trip to a local central vacuum store for unique fittings. $5.00 later and another 30 minutes and the unit is now fully operating.now testing. plugged the hose in, attached the wand and vacuum head, turned it on and wow, it works great, great suction (i have a 2500 sq ft home and bought the 6000 sq ft unit). i over bought so there would be redundancy in the power available. the cost differential wasn't significant and my perceived redundancy worth the cost.tools. in addition to the complete indoor tool set, hose, hose cover, etc. it also includes a complete set of garage tools and hose, what a great surprise.in my area, retailers charge around $1,500 and up for a vacuum and installation. if you're the least bit handy around these type things, you will have no issues with the installation. i have no idea how much they would charge to install a third party vacuum.\n",
      "the vacuum system was delivered fairly quickly and was packaged well.  it included all the accessories shown in the image.  the system was easy to install and it works very well.  it is quite loud but since it is mounted in the garage, it does not really affect anything.  if i was to exhaust it to the outside, i am sure it would drop the noise level considerably.the house was wired and piped for a central vac system, but none was installed.  i purchased this system based on the reviews and i am very happy with it.  i like the fact that the exhaust is outside the house unlike free standing vacuums and this system produces much greater suction than any portable vacuum i have ever owned.it comes with a lot of accessories and the carpet head works well.  i can run the head up to the wall and it will clean right to the wall, unlike other vacuums i have had in the past that would only get to within a half inch or so of the wall.  i would recommend this to anyone looking for a central vac system.\n",
      "great to have a central vac in house again.  after having beam units in last two houses, and having gone to a shark for this latest house, we really understood why we like central units better.  the only reason this unit is getting 4 stars rather than 5 is the dirt canister seal and mounting method.  beam has a more user friendly method to empty waste.  as far as components, the power head of this unit imo is better than others i have used, it has indicator lights that let you know if your overloading the brush by setting too low or wrap somthing into it.  accessory kit and garage pack seem to include all to attachments you could need and the telescopic wand for powerhead is nice for different user heights.  with vaulted ceilings my 5 foot tall wife can add the wand sections and reach ceiling fan blades even 11 feet up for dusting.  ordered the honeywell installation pack for piping and had this up and running a couple hours after receiving it.\n",
      "this is a great set.  it includes everything you need and some you don't.  the extra hose would be great for a house with an attached garage.  it is perfect for our small house.\n",
      "i did hours of research on vacuums before i finally went with this one - major reason i went with this one is the value most other vacuums cost this much with out any accessories and this one is the full meal deal, the outlet on the front of the unit is amazing for using in the garage. installation was very very simple just need to get a couple fittings and a piece of vac pipe from a local vacuum store.  i recommend this product highly,\n",
      "i love having a central vac, however, it took forever to arrive over 2 weeks, the hose should really be 35 foot for inside and the floor brush is so small it takes forever to vac all of my tile floors.\n",
      "the machine has great suction. great value. a little louder than i expected. but overall good quality and great price.\n",
      "though i thought it odd that it was shipped via the erie canal, the item did finally arrive and works well.\n",
      "works as described. one question i had was answered promptly by the seller.definitely 5*****\n",
      "works so good, i thought it was made in the usa\n",
      "looks great . cannot wait to use it. thanks\n",
      "it was as advertised. doing the job nicely\n",
      "good product at great price\n",
      "best vaccum i've owned,\n",
      "this vacuum sucks, i mean really sucks, 1 month in and it is the most powerful central vac i have ever used. if you like powerful sucking as far as vacuums.this is the one,\n",
      "the machine is very high quality and it was delivered in about 3 days.  i am very pleased with the performance, but i question why the company does not supply a written operation/installation manual.  a disc (cd) was supplied, but i found it hard to navigate and lacking in many areas that i had questions about.  when i contacted the company i was able to speak to someone who seemed able to answer my questions, but he was not at all receptive when i requested a written document.\n",
      "this product sucks no i mean it really sucks, a lot more power than a lot of household vacuum cleaners.\n",
      "so far i am completely satisfied with this product.  product was packed well. installed easily enough.  operates with no problem and has strong suction. i am not sure how easily i will be able to replace components like belts for the power head since that has not been an issue yet.  seems well made.  power head is light and easy to use.  long hose is a bit awkward but since it is really long (25-30 ft), what do you expect,one note i would give to people who plan to install this yourself: the 2\" plastic tubing you need to connect this system to your existing piping is not available at your typical home improvement store.  you will have to go to a specialty store or order it through amazon as i did.\n",
      "at less than half the price of getting the same (or really inferior) thing from our local supplier, this would really have to be a dog to get a bad review. besides the great price it was easy to install and works very well. i'm still trying to figure out the optimal solution for storing the hose, but i'm working on it.\n",
      "i was very intimidated at installing it into our rv. however, i managed to do it one sleepless night by myself, my husband woke up the next morning and it was perfectly done and works and looks great in our rv. i didn't like the \"almond\" color face plate, so i spray painted it bronze so it would look better and match our camper decor. you would think the entire setup came with the rv. as long as you follow the directions and the dimensions in the instructions, it's a breeze,the amount of suction that this unit produces blows away my shop•vac brand vacuum, watch your fingers on the hose when you plug it in. if you do like i did and test it on your hand (don't we all do that?) when you first plug it in, the suction shrinks up the hose and can pinch your fingers. the first things i used this on was a vacuum storage bag with a pillow and some sheets in it. i wanted to compare how fast and how much air it would take out compared to the shop•vac, and the difference isn't even comparable. this was done in less than 10 seconds, and it took out more air,after the install, i had a bit of a mess to clean up inside the cabinets and on the carpet and hard floor, and this just sucked it right up with no problem. i used the included rug rat \"power\" brush, and it was fantastic. fluffed up the carpets and took all the wood splinters and dust away. the attachment doesn't actually have power going to it, but the strong force of the suction makes the brush spin and it is very effective.if you're looking to install this in your rv but have been ambivalent about the install and the effectiveness, i'm sure you won't be disappointed if you buy it, also, i bought the automatic dustpan floor accessory and didn't even install it. you don't need to with this. why store a broom in your rv when you have this beast that includes bare floor attachments? it's overkill.tip: make sure you feed the wire that attached to the face plate through both the inner bracket and the hole before you attach the wire to the face plate itself, it does sort of warn you in the instructions when to attach the wire, but it fails to remind you to feed it through first,\n",
      "we own a 32 foot winnebago vista and have three kids.  when we go camping, we get a lot of dirt into the rv.  i decided to try this dirt devil to get relief from the sweeping and the hand vacuuming we had to do.  i watched some videos on how to install it and saw all the positive reviews about it.i'm not a mechanic or a particularly talented handyman so it had to be simple to install.  to my great relieve, it was very simple.  i install my unit under a bench seat in the dining area, laying horizontal, cut a hole for the attachment and another hole as a vent. i was very surprised on how powerful the unit is.using the vacuum is simple.  plug in the hose and attach what nozzle you want to use.  the expandable hose will reach the entire interior of the motorhome with no problem.  it works equally well on the linoleum and the rug.the only drawback i have found so far, is that the main hose has some pullback when you start to pull it out to it's longer lengths.  it feels as if it is trying to pull away from you.  but that is a minor issue compared to how well it works.\n",
      "i am an hp products authorized dealer. fyi all dirt devil central vacuum products are made by hp products. these are fine, high quality units that will give you many years of trouble free service. just remember to change your bag and locate the unit where it can get a good supply of fresh incoming air as it moves a large amount of air as it operates. these work great under the dinette seats in rv's i recommend installing a vent grille from a rv heating system or a marine type louvered grille for the air intake. as far as colors of inlet valves as mentioned, they are available in many colors. you can also connect a vacpan which really makes a nice addition to an rv. i will be happy to assist you with any questions, accessories, or partsnbsoundworks@yahoo.com\n",
      "this is also known as the red devil 1500 rv central vac.  the unit was easy to install on my boat, under the seat cushion in the cabin.  just takes a few minutes.  the unit is pretty powerful for it size, it is relatively small, about the size of a breadbox.  given that it cleans remarkably well.  do not expect it to work as well as a full size vacuum but it does come very close.  tool kit with attachements is very complete.\n",
      "put this in my small sprinter based motorhome.  works great,small size a big plus.telescope inlet pipe a plus.even the small head upholstery brush works well.seems to bag most of the dust, i've seen no problem with dust in the cabinet where i mounted it.no more big unwieldy vacs to store and lug around.\n",
      "outstanding ,installed it, and the dometic dust port under the (island) sink in our 30' fifth wheel. the hose reaches both ends of the rig, no problem. the \"rug rat\" does an outstanding job. on what little carpet/rugs we have. the dust port is very handy.on the floor, under the vac port. in  the middle of the \"downstairs\" area, just inside the entry door.where foot traffic dirt is an issue. just a touch of the broom. dirt is history. no more dust pan.wired the system so either the vac port, or the dust port. turns the system on & off.5th rv. in 40 years of the rv life style. don't know what took us so long to install a cenvac system.\n",
      "ok first this thing is outstanding. but. it creates too much suction.  good and bad thing.  unless you have wtw carpet or hard floors it is a hassle to use on area rugs or runners.  it sucks the rugs and runners up and your fighting to get it to let them go. (i blame that on the hose that comes with the kit because it has no suction valve control)  and it would have been nice to have an on/off switch in the handle instead of having to leave it run or go unplug the hose to stop the vacuum) but for the price of the unit and accessories i can handle the shortcomings.\n",
      "this product is awesome and so much better than lugging a vacuum around inside the 5th wheel.\n",
      "just finished installing this in our 2015 bounder, and also installed the vac pan. we have two dogs and one is a newfoundland mix, his hair is everywhere. we have tried many different types of vacuums, from battery powered hand held, to power vacuums, none of them could keep up with the hair. this thing is amazing, money well spent. we fight over who gets to vacuum.\n",
      "wow,  this is one of the best upgrades i've ever done to my fifth wheel camper.  this unit is awesome,  great for carpet, floors, pleated shades,cornices, upholstery, ect.  i don't know why i waited so long for this.  every rv camper should have one of these installed from the factory,\n",
      "this vacuum is awesome in my 5th wheel. it was simple to install and only took about an hour. now cleaning is easy and the attachments store easily.\n",
      "works great and the hose and attachments are very durable with easy installation.\n",
      "on time and complete as promised. great product. easy to install\n",
      "this vac really sucks, it works fantastic in our motor home,\n",
      "replacement for previous dirt devil in motorhome. liked improvements made in the 10 years. easy install except for the wire at inside door. found it difficult to get the wires into the 2 small holes.\n",
      "easy to install, has lots of suction, came with more tools than i need, and has a hose long enough to vacuum the neighbors next door,  well.almost.\n",
      "perfect fit in my thor ace motorhome. incredible suction. the hose expands enough to reach front to back. i'm so glad we installed this vacuum.\n",

      "i bought this to replace a vintage nutone 350.  looking at the price/specs,  i'd been planning on getting one of these when my nutone failed.  finally,  it did.  the imperium cv300 has more power and makes less noise than the unit it replaced.  it's easier to change the bags also.  design wise,  the majority of the cost is in the motor.  this unit is all about the motor,  and the rest is made from simple sheet metal.  it's made well, but you can see they are shooting for max power without extra costs.  the extra valve to put near the unit is a nice addition.  good job cvs,\n",
      "the unit has been great. one of the guys on site had installed the internal filter incorrectly, leading to it being really load and the motor failing. i had forgotten about this review. the unit has been great.\n",

      "excellent vaccum , great suction\n",
      "this thing works great. like another reviewer said, i was apprehensive about buying a brand with which i was not familiar but this works really well so far. i have had it installed for about 2 months.i purchased just the canister as this was a replacement for my old central unit that died after 16years. my only complaint is that it came with no instructions for installation or an owners manual or paperwork of any kind. the installation was easy enough since i had done it before but attaching the filter was not as straightforward. we got it on there but i am still not sure it is done correctly but there wasn't another way to get it on so.i liked the price and i think the value is exceptional.\n",
      "this is a well built vacuum.  i have it installed in a 5000 sqft house and there is plenty of suction at the furthest run which is about 115 feet of tubing.  its easily twice the suction as my portable shop vac.\n",
      "i don't  usually buy things unless there are a lot of reviews by others saying the product is worth having or not.  with this central vac unit i took a chance because of the stantially higher cost of the name brand units.  this one is made from ultra clean, you cannot go wrong.  i do think that for what you pay for it, should get a sock for the hose thrown in on the deal as that is the very next purchase i made immediately after this one.about the unit.you are getting a good quality product that is obviously made in canada because of the logo of their symbol is on it.  it is very powerful and is great for my house being right around the 2000 square foot mark.  even though this unit will do up to 7500sq feet.  the bin in which you empty it from is well thought out and easy to remove.  the only reasons i didn't score it 5 stars is because it is kinda noisy, but it is in my garage so its not that big of a deal for me, but some of you would have to put it in your basement.  but thats why they do make exhaust mufflers for these things, and again i think it should be included as well, and secondly of course the above-mentioned no sock included with the purchase.  other than that i am glad i bought it.\n",
      "we moved from a 4500 sq ft house with a central vac to a 2000 sq ft house without one, my wife ask if we could install one in the new house,well you know us men sure we can do anything, after 3 days of running pipe,wiring,and cutting in the wall intakes it was finished, the unit runs great, i checked around before getting the ultra clean and my supply comp. in our town could not beat the price on this unit, glad we got the ultra clean the wife loves it, anyone needing a new vac system you can't go wrong with this one.\n",
      "well built, much better than the contractor grade vacuum that came with the house.  this vacuum has a lot of suction on the 2nd floor ( vacuum is in the basement).  very satisfied\n",
      "this is the 4th one that i have purchased, you absolutely cannot beat it.\n",
      "should have ordered this earlier, excellent power.\n",
      "easy to install. this vacuum works better than expected.  my wife thought we could do without it, but she changed her mind after our first trip with it. i especially like how the attachments and hose can be tucked away without taking up a lot of space. this vacuum is well worth it.\n",
      "installed perfectly under the bed. it has a long hose to reach all over 38 foot motorhome. easy to install.\n",
      "bought this unit for our condo.  easy to use and the hose reaches all areas.\n",
      "identical replacement. fast shipping.\n",
      "perfectdanke\n",
      "fit perfectly into the opening and looks very solid. not powerful enough for a residence but very effective in the motor home. i did not use the inlet port that comes with the unit. instead i installed the floor port and in a 31' motor home the single hose port in the main unit is sufficient to reach all spaces.\n",
      "one of the outlet pipes was cracked and easily fixed with duct tape.  no electrical connectors were provided for the low voltage wires coming from my house.  fortunately, i had some in my shop.  the unit was relatively easy to install and appears to function as advertised.  the cv12000 replaced a worn out airvac unit and i am overall pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "the only problem i had with our prolux cv12000 central vacuum was the directions.  the enclosed booklet was missing a couple of pages and was not concise.  when i called, emailed with questions they were answered promptly.  some one with more experience installing a unit would not have struggled.\n",
      "this was my first central vacuum, and i installed the entire system (3 inlets) in an existing house with the help of my wife.  i took a chance with this unit, and it paid off so far.  the unit is sturdy and well built.  the suction is amazing, and it's not as noisy as i thought it would be. i have it installed in our lower level garage.  i'll update this review over time assuming i remember.\n",
      "excelent transaction. very nice unit with tons of suction. much stronger than the one that came with the house.\n",
      "product came very well packaged.  package included power unit, power cord, mounting bracket, cap for second suction input and muffler assembly.  this hooked right up with no issues to existing pre-run vacuum lines in home and 2 wire outlet switching system.  the suction from this unit is impressive,  connected in a 3000sq/ft home, the suction available at anyone of several outlets in the home is fantastic,  the unit is rather large with a very large collection bin.  the added garage connection is also a nice feature.  would definitely recommend.\n",
      "i bought this to use for a small wood shop dust collector i make pens , hunting calls and sawdust. i had a big 4\" 2hp system and it just did not work all that well, we have a central vac in our house i an got thinking what if i could get that kind of power? yes i could have hooked into the house system, but the wife would not like for some reason i am sure.i have hooked up to 7 machines and a floor sweep it works great still not the suction the house one has but plenty of power for my shop, and it is so quiet compared to the old one which was very loud so this is cool.\n",
      "great vacuum, the suction is what they claim. my old unit had two large motors that didn't have the close to the power this unit has with one motor. thing to know, this motor takes about 3-4 seconds to spool up. once it is going suction is awesome.prolux cv12000 central vacuum power unit with most powerful 2 speed motor and 25 year warranty,\n",
      "like that this does not require finding specialized bags. the muffler really lessons the noise from the unit. wish it came with the needed electrical clips, but found some at hardware store that worked. suction seems good throughout 3000 square foot house. really glad that this comes with an inlet on the unit itself so it cam be used in the garage.\n",
      "this vac works great and is very quiet. it exhausts to outside and the muffler wasn't needed. replaced a 30+ yr old unit and installation was easy. it arrived a few days earlier than originally expected so kudos to the seller,\n",
      "this unit is far superior to the nutone unit it replaced.  no complaints.  very quiet operation.\n",
      "excellent upgrade to my 9 year old airvac avr-7500. this thing sucks,,,\n",
      "i purchased the system several weeks ago.  i rated the system four stars.  the central unit is a 5 star unit, but the attachments are 3 star.  generally speaking i'm extremely happy with the central unit.  i installed it on a 3500 sq. ft. house.  here are my thoughts about the system.1.  the central unit is much, much quieter than the old filtrex unit it replaced.2.  the central unit comes with a muffler on the exhaust.  the exhaust needs to be vented to the outside especially if the unit is located in the basement or other living areas.  prior to purchasing the system be sure you have a plan to route the exhaust piping to the outside.3.  the instructions to install the central unit are only average.  the central comes with two suction ports that can used to pipe to different areas of the house.  the second port can be capped if it is not needed.  there also is a third port directly on the unit where the vacuum hose can be connected.  the instructions do not mention anything about these ports.  remember vacuum pipe different than the pipe you can get at a home center.  you'll need to purchase some online or at a local vacuum store.4  the attachments are average.  the hose is very light.  the electric head has six carpet heights.  if you don't have the correct height selected, the beater brushes will pull the head across the carpet.  if that happens, select a higher carpet height on the head unit.5.  there is a switch at the top of the hose, off, i, ii.  there are no instructions on what i or ii means.  each turns on the central unit without any noticeable sound or suction difference.6.  the aluminum tube permanently connects to the electric head.  a second tube is needed and not provided to connect to the hardwood floor attachment.  the hardwood floor attachment does swivel.  i can't review it since i haven't purchased another tube.all in all i would have purchased this again now knowing the systems flaws.  it was delivered missing a few of the attachments.  i did email the supplier who quickly shipped the attachments.  i also emailed the supplier about some installation details.  again they were very responsive and helpful.\n",
      "i'm a home builder and have done just about every major brand of central vac units, this is the 1st prolux i have put in my own personal house. the vacuum itself is great, good suction coming out of the wall & low noise volume. would give just vacuum 5 stars if i had just bought it alone & if i did it again would just get the vac unit, buy attachments from another company,,,,the attachments are horrible, tried a friends attachments that are another brand and it worked great. the prolux attachments cut down air flow by 1/2 i would say, wouldn't pick up things the size of a pea.\n",
      "we have not owned a central vacuum system before, so this is our first. our house is a two story, 3400 square feet with 3 outlets on each floor. i installed this system because i discovered our house was built with the room outlets for central-vac pre-installed. also, my wife has allergies so i figured exhausting all the dust to the outside instead of relying on filters in vacuum cleaners to remove it all was a better idea. she also has back trouble so i was looking for a way to lighten the load of hauling a conventional vac around the house - especially up the stairs.all the pipes and wires for the system were installed and dropped into the crawl space, so most of the hard work was done by the builder (our house is 10 years old and we bought it 2 years ago).  i had to run the main trunk line in the crawl space and connect all the outlets into it, then hook up the wiring. i installed the vacuum unit in our 3-car garage right beside the back door. the whole project took about 5 hours.one strange thing i found with central vacs is that the 2\" pvc piping is quite hard to find. the big box stores don't stock it, although they do stock some of the elbows and tees. i had to do a lot of surfing to find 8 foot long vacuum piping. i didn't try to use common schedule 40 pvc piping (which you can find anywhere) because several sites advised against it (vacuum pipe is schedule 20).my wife absolutely loves this system. the hose and vacuum head are much easier to work with than a conventional vacuum cleaner. the vacuum suction is real strong and it does a great job on everything. it's a very different experience with how quiet it is compared to a regular vacuum cleaner. our downstairs is about 75% hardwood and 25% carpet. upstairs is all carpet. this systems works very well on both. we're very pleased with it and we'd recommend it to anyone. we have two small dogs and conventional vacs always had that \"dog\" smell in them. this system puts everything to the outdoors (well, to the garage anyway), so we don't have the dog dandruff smell anymore. all-in-all, i can't say enough about this system. i'd have installed this years ago if i'd only known how nice it is.one note: these systems commonly have a \"sweep\" outlet in the kitchen. ours was plumbed for it, but i didn't install that. we just never use a broom in the kitchen. we vacuum instead.i've been advised by a friend who's had central vacs for many years that the main weakness in these systems in general is the motor. this product has a 10-year warranty on the motor, which is pretty good compared to some others, so i'm going to make sure i keep the proper paperwork for that.\n",
      "i purchased the  prolux cv12000 to replace a unit that i installed when i built my home. the prolux is much more powerful-it provides great suction at the farthest point in my 5,000 sq. ft. home. the vac pan in the kitchen also works much better now too. an added benefit is how quiet it is,i hardly notice it being on when i'm out in the garage.\n",
      "we have had our prolux vacuum for a few weeks now. we love it,  it replaced a beam unit that the motor had burned up.  the prolux was shipped and arrived quickly.  it was really quite easy to match to the existing piping and electrical. it has great suction and even though it came with an exhaust line muffler, it is much quieter than the beam unit. so far, it is a super good find and the company who shipped it to us from west jordan, utah has been extra-ordinarily good with follow-up to make sure we had an awesome customer experience.\n",
      "we purchased a new 3900 square foot house that was plumbed for central vac.  my husband was able to install this very easily so we saved a ton of money as compared to going through a retail store and it works extremely well.  we have three dogs and it picks up all the pet hair quickly and easily. we ordered a sock for the hose to make sure it didn't scratch our hardwoods.\n",
      "this vacuum is great. i replaced my 28 year old unit with this one. it was easy to install and much more powerful. i was also very surprised at how quite this unit is. it is installed in my basement and with the vacuum on all you hear is the air being sucked through the hose. the carpet brush is fantastic, we had always kept a upright vacuum to do our carpets but we no longer need to because this attachment works much better. it was hard to find the right size pipe to replace the old elbows to connect the vacuum to the existing piping. i would suggest buying some elbows when you order this, they are cheap and it will save you time.\n",
      "i don't think this vacuum is near as powerful as my old beam. i'm very disappointed and i threw away my beam, if i still had it i'd switch back.?\n",
      "this vacuum was installed in a spec home that i am building.  the installation was easy and is seems like it will be a very good vacuum system for this home.  very good quality product,\n",
      "we bought the unit as a real cement when our old unit died.  much better suction and very quiet.  easy to install.  would recommend\n",
      "the prolux cv12000 has plenty of power and is very quiet. customer service is great with greatvacs\n",
      "very powerful and much quieter than my old central vac.which was very old but still worked.\n",
      "we had this for about a year now, works great. more power, less noise.  very happy with it.\n",
      "this was an awesome replacement vacation for my grandma home,exactly what we wanted,,,\n",
      "this thing really sucks (in a great way), easy to install and works well.\n",
      "12000 not nearly powerful enough for 8000 ft. home.very disappointed\n",
      "great unit, quick shipping. thanks,,\n",
      "very powerful vacuum,,,.\n",
      "superb.\n",
      "everything was as expected and seems to be a great value for the product\n",
      "works great\n",
      "amazing does not even begin to describe this. this does way more than just vacuum. (see photos)this is a complete home cleaning system like you've never experienced before. having everything that's being vacuumed immediately after it leaves the hose that sucks it up dumped it into a vat of water is positively genius. dust is tough, if not impossible to contain unless you put it in a vat of water.i agree with the reviews were they tell you to buy it directly from a rainbow home demo/ authorized dealer. rainbow should hook up with amazon so that they can sell them through amazon as well. then you get the best of both worlds.this is positively the best clean my home has ever received.the review that complains about all the gross stuff that comes out of  your house when you use this vacuum is worded very negatively and is a terrible representation of what this cleaning system does.  it makes it sound like it's a bad thing. i would much rather that pile of nastiness be somewhere designated outside like in the garden or just in a trash bag until the water dissipates then in my home. as soon as i got this i vacuumed everything in my house… walls anything that collects dust hanging on the walls etc.this is the best thing that has ever happened to me & my home.not only does this the rainbow clean your home, but it is also an air purifier that is designed to run 24/7 and take existing dust and dirt floating in the air out of your home environment. you can also add essential oils in order to not only clean the air but freshening it to make it smell good as well.well worth the investment. what you spend over the years buying and replacing vacuums and filters ( or time spent cleaning filters) will equal out to be what you spend all at one time on a rainbow.when you look at the photos… gross gross & gross, .  let me just add that i am a very clean…ocd clean person. i regularly clean walls and thoroughly and frequently. i also clean baseboards and floors. this system still somehow managed to get all of this nastiness out of one small room.\n",
      "although i didn't order from amazon i do own this model rainbow vac. for me, it's perfect because it's everything in one. i've helped friends and family with all their household projects and lent the vac for them to use as well. everyone i've let use it or done work for have absolutely loved it. i use to clean houses and apartments commercially and this piece of machine was just what i needed, all-in-one, i really do love this vac.\n",
      "fantastic product and great service, well worth every penny, i'm a pediatric home healthcare nurse and any family with children should invest  in this vacuum. best thing i ever purchased, should be on every wedding/baby registry,\n",
      "very easy to manuver with the six caster dolly and filtration is superb. the accessories are right there on the machine to go from floors to ceiling. the quality is good and the savings are huge online versus the distributor price.\n",
      "i have a love/hate relationship with this vacuum.reasons why i love it:- picks up pet hair and dust hair without stirring it back into the air.- don't ever have to buy vacuum filters.- the carpet attachment has a hand control so you can stop it suddenly.- it doubles as an air purifier.- the warrantyreasons why i hate it:- you are constantly rolling over the cord and getting tangled up. be prepared for you back to hurt after lifting it so many times.- the way it's designed it's like dragging an uncooperative small child around. i've dinged up furniture, molding and sides of doors trying to go from room to room. also, have fun with the stairs. while it's at the top you're praying it won't all of a sudden come rolling down and take you out while trying to reach the middle stairs.- not intended for a quick clean. you have to fill the bowl up with water and must empty it when your done. otherwise there's the mildew.- where to dispose of the. results? at the end you have a bowl filled with a combination of mud, pet hair and god-knows what else. it is suggested either to throw it outside or down the toilet. i don't feel like risking my plumbing, so outside i have a nasty pile of what appears to be part of a werewolf. and god forbid you ever accidentally spill a dirty bowl.- the \"warranty\". so yes, please by from a licensed distributor to ensure you get the actual rainbow warranty. but apparently it doesn't cover regular maintenance cleanings or fixing the hose which had gotten wedged under a car tire. i had to pay out-of-pocket for that.in conclusion, it's great if you like taking the time to do a deep cleaning and don't mind regularly cleaning the bowl. but if you just want a quick vacuum, you better have a different one. i also wish the design was different. there's a reason why this style went out. maybe if they had it in a smaller back pack version, like some commercial vacuums. i miss my old vacuum where the cord would wind up automatically and was 1/20th the price.\n",
      "awesome machine and for half price, or 1000 bucks less depending upon the sales office.  brand new with the pet add-ons.  the disgustingness of the water only illustrates the incompetence of other vacuums.  literally vacuumed a 5x7 rug and the dog hair and dirt it sucked out made the water black, so i emptied and rinsed the tub.  did another rug and did the same.  did a carpeted living room and them emptied.  granted i changed the water probably more than needed, but still, what i picked up in just these three small areas would have been enough to fill a regular vacuum bag.  we have only lived in this house for 4 months and have vacuumed with a regular vacuum a few times. the absolute only negative i can state is that it is pretty heavy and doesn't roll around very well on carpet.  if you don't have many large rooms with carpet it is easily manageable though.\n",
      "i too did not buy my rainbow online but i just recently got this machine bit without the pet attachments. 95% of my floors are hardwood or tile and i love this new vacuum head. no beater bar so i can run right over my floors after cleaning the entryway rug. i like the way the brushes sweep the dirt in toward the vacuum head and its power driven. this newer model does follow better and rolls easier than the old model i had. suction is great and the redesigned water bowl is much easier to clean. having lots of pets & living in the country with the dust pollen etc it cleans great. i do empty outside and rinse with water hose before bringing it inside. i then wipe it good, refill & leave out. the biggest reason for this purchase was that since it also cleans the air (on hi a bit noisy), it can always be ready to use. i work plus have a business and have a crew of critters which have to be tended to in the evenings after work. doesn't give me much evening time to vac daily. hubby no longer drives and is home so i am hoping he will run it every other day for me ?.i had my old rainbow 15+ years and it was used when i got it, it still worked great and was my favorite. we also had an upright that hubby said he would use if i bought. the distributor was offering $300 for any brand of old vacuums if purchasing that day (at home demo), $350 if a rainbow. i gave him both vacs and got my new for about the same price as this offer. while hubby as yet to use it i have noticed my floors are cleaner than they use to be when cleaning day rolls around.\n",
      "excellent product\n",
      "buyer bewarewhen you purchase a rainbow, you are buying many years of product development, continuous improvement and ingenuity. plus, your rainbow is supported by rexair llc and by your local independent authorized rainbow distributor.do not make the mistake of purchasing your rainbow from an unauthorized retailer.only an authorized rainbow distributor/dealer can sell and support an authentic rainbow.\n",
      "love.love love\n",
      "hi,i bought a rainbow vacuum cleaner and it cost $3321 but i just realize that its so expensive?is it a scam?or does it worth the money? it'sstressing me out.\n",
      "don't waste your money.\n",
      "easy to install and works like a champ. far better than the money i wasted on a honeywell that lasted 3 months and 2 days. this one is well worth the extra bucks.\n",
      "i have had several portable handheld vacuum cleaners over the years. they all had one common problem - the battery. rechargeable battery life is not holding up very long on these devices, and it takes several hours to recharge it. most of the time when you need to vacuum, often the vacuum is dead because out of battery.this hotor dc 12 volt 106 watts wet and dry handheld vacuum with long power cord eliminates that problem. not only vacuum dry debris, this vacuum also can vacuum wet items or liquid spills. when you ready to vacuum, the battery (capacity) is not the limit. you can vacuum much longer and ready to go at anytime. best of all, there is air filter to prevent dust going out on the other end – this is might help if people have minor allergies (note: i believed the filter is not hepa). besides that great feature, the extension hose, crevice tool and brush attachment work perfectly.pros:-  dc 12 volt (no battery problems)-  wet and dry vacuum-  portable-  lightweight-  long car lighter cable (16.5 feet)-  easy to empty dust bowl-  easy to use and handle-  great build material-  great price-  air filter (to prevent debris and dust coming outfrom other end)-  great accessories (storage carrying bag, crevicetool, extension hose and brush)-  great for car-  great warrantycons:-  none\n",
      "when the manufacturer sent me this in exchange for an honest review, my husband rolled his eyes.he is really particular about his vehicles (has them detailed professionally), but he agreed to give it a shot.when it first arrived, you could see that he was super skeptical.  first he wondered if they pieces all fit in the bag (they did).  then he wondered if it could be dismantled for cleaning (it can).he took it outside and vacuumed his freshly-washed car.and came back with a vacuum that had picked up a bunch of dirt in his squeaky-clean car.  haha.  (see pic) now he's hooked,  he went from rolling his eyes to telling me to tell you all that this is a great thing to buy, and a must-have if you are totally uptight like he is.it works great, is easy to empty and clean, and everything fits in the bag. my apologies for how amazon uploaded my photos.  i'm not sure why this happens from time to time.\n",
      "this review is for a car vacuum cleaner that is dc12-volt 106w. this portable handheld vacuum can handle both wet & dry  with the 16.4ft(5m) power cord that it comes with. it also tucks away into a nice compact blacl carry bag with zipper.here are some pros & cons:pro:it can handle both wet & dry dirt.cord is long enough for inside of the car.it comes with attachment heads.it comes with hose extension.awwit comes with a carry case to keep it contained.cons:wish the suction was bit stronger but still gets the job done.overall, this will come in handy and having this will get the job done.if you have found my photos and review to be helpful, please click on \"helpful\" ,) i am an avid amazon shopper and depend on the reviews of others to help make my purchases. i would only return the same favor back to the community and pride myself on being as honest in my reviews as possible. i hope this was helpful.\n",
      "first of i have to say that this car vacumm comes very well equipped with 2 filters, many adds-on and a great bag that fits it all.is a good size, not heavy and seems well constructed. it is all in all very compact to carry in the car.now the only downside, which my not be a downside for everyone, is that it only has on/off meaning it only has one velocity and is not a very powerful one.yes it can clean you car and all but i think this is more for in case of an emergency. for example if you eat in the car and/or spill something, this car vacumm makes it very easy to clean something on the spot. but if you want this to actually fully clean your car then it might take you a while to vacumm it because again is not that very powerful.in conclusion, who is this vacunmer for? i would say for people that travel a lot in their cars (like me), for someone that has kids, for someone that has grandkids or babysits, or for just about anyone that likes to keep their car clean then this is something that you can carry in your car all the time in case of an emergency. yes there are such things as cleaning emergencies,all in all is a good car vacunmer, compact, simple to use, good features and nice carrying bag.if this review helped you please click yes, and if you have any questions comment down below.thank you,\n",
      "this vacuum is just what i had been looking for.  it is the perfect size and has the ability to handle vacuuming the entire vehicle, as well as just small spills.  the tools are easy to attach and work wonderfully to get into the small areas that you would otherwise be unable to reach using just the vacuum itself.  i love that it plugs right into the cigarette lighter outlet for power, unlike the ones where you have to remember to keep charged.  no worries with this one.  the extra filter is also a lifesaver for those times when you haven't cleaned in awhile and need to clean the filter before finishing the whole vehicle.  with the extra filter, you can just pop the new one in and then clean them both once you are finished.  i also love that it comes with a storage bag, that everything conveniently fits in.\n",
      "the hotor dc12-volt 106w wet&dry portable handheld auto vacuum cleaner is an amazing portable, yet powerful car vacuum, i was thoroughly impressed with how powerful the vacuum was since its footprint is tiny. i plugged this into the 12 volt outlet in my car and turned it on. i used it to vacuum the floor mat in the front seat as it was the dirtiest. i didn't hold out much hope for this one as it is 12 volt. well what a pleasant surprise when this really worked well. the suction was very strong. this comes with the adapters and tools you need to get the job done. a zippered carrying case is included, so i can place my vacuum either in the garage or in the back of your car.\n",
      "this is a really nice hand vac and it really sucks up everything in your car.  i don't live in the city so i'm always tracking and gravel and little tiny rocks in my car even right in front of my house. and this whole thing sucks up anything don't let the size fool you.the vacuum comes with a nice little handbag the stores all the pieces and the doctors for it which is pretty nifty at stores nice and easy in my trunk without disturbing anything else or making less room.my only vice would be that the cord has to be plugged into the cigarette lighter you can't use a regular house plug if that makes any sense. i have a four-door car and this doesn't handwritten anyway but if you're looking for something for a van, you would have to have a cigarette adapter in the back part for it to reach to the third row.i did test it to see if it would suck up stuff that was moist and it did so i was pretty pleased with that. overall i'm really happy with it i only convert be the power source. if you have any further questions that i have yet to answer in this review you can always reach out to me and i couldn't answer you as best as i can. thank y'all \n",
      "i don't live in a great neighborhood so i don't like going to gas stations by myself to vacuum out my car which has lead to crumbs and dust and who knows what else adding up on my floors. i also don't like wasting my much needed laundry quarters on it either. this hotor car vacuum cleaner was just what i needed, it doesn't require batteries and can be plugged into the car directly just like a car phone charger, the suction on the vacuum isn't as strong as a gas station vacuum but with a little patience all the small pieces can get picked up, i'm not complaining, i would recommend this to everybody, you can vacuum from the comfort of your own garage or car port or anywhere you might be, now i won't be so crazy when my 6 year old is eating foods that tend to crumble, this is amazing, and afterwards it's so easy to clean, empty out and arrow away,\n",
      "i had read good things about this vac and was anxious to try it out (and my car certainly needed it,) plugged it in using the included car adapter for the cigarette lighter and went to work, picking up all sorts of stuff from the carpet and seats. attached the hose, which is fairly long, and was able to suck out between the seats. i have two major takeaways from using the vac:1. it's substantial. it has a lightweight feel but it is also \"heavy\" which speaks to the  quality of the motor. this is a powerful vac. it really is surprising given the cost.2. it comes with a lot of extra. the little attachments make it easier to detail your car and really get into those out of the way spots.if you're teetering on the edge between a more expensive model and this one, get this one, i've owned a few vacs in my day for auto detailing, and this one is a lot better than the \"big\" brands. and it has a neat carrying case. you don't get that with most similar products. you will love this,,\n",
      "keeping our car clean and organized is sometimes hard to do if you are too busy and always in rush or especially if you have kids. as a mom it is natural for us to see our house and car full of mess. i'm glad i bought this hotor car vacuum. it's been very helpful for us. i can clean our car in no time.what i really like about this is that-it's portable and lightweight you can bring it anywhere. very convenient.- multifunction. it has 3 attachments that you can use in different ways.-it has a long tube for extension for you to reach the sides of the car that you can't reach.-powerful suction and fastnow i am not worrying if my kids are are messy as long as i have this car vacuum.worth the price. i will definitely recommend this.\n",
      "this little vac came in really handy when my kid dropped an open box of cereal on the seat and floor of my car the other day.  i was really glad to have it.  i did have to return one, but had no problems getting a replacement and that one works like a champ.  i am happy with this vac and, i get a replacement filter extra.  i have a bit of over planning and always try to keep extra filters and things so awesome bonus,  the cord is long enough to get into the farthest reaches and with the extra hose attachment i got into places i hadn't in years.  everything even fits into the bag, even the extra pieces so everything is tidy and neat.  overall i am very pleased with this purchase and think it will last for a long time.\n",
      "the wet/dry vacuum is so handy to keep in the boat, car or camping equipment.  it stores into a medium size bag to carry around.  since it will clean up either wet or dry it does not matter what spills, just grab it and clean it up.  it has tools to get into those tiny crevices that food seem to find to easily.  the cord is over 16 feet long so you have ample cord in most cases.  it has a filter for those with allergies to dust, just wash it occasionally to clean.  the suction with this is excellent, it picks up with no problem.  leaves the car seats and mats looking great.  this would be the perfect groomsmen gift or for anyone who loves a clean car or boat.\n",
      "this review is for a car vacuum cleaner that is dc12-volt 106w. this portable handheld vacuum is targeted to your vehicle and can handle wet & dry cleanup.  it comes with a 16.4ft(5m) power cord. it also tucks away into a nice compact black bag with zipper that will hold the attachments. there is even an extra filter.pro:it can handle both wet & dry cleanup.cord is long enough for inside of the car.it comes with attachment heads.it comes with hose extensionit comes with a carry casecons:suction is decent.  no worse than similar handheld vacuums, but don't expect a dyson.overall, this will come in handy and having this will get the job done.\n",
      "hotor car vacuum cleaner is great to keep in the car with you, especially if you have young kids, this vacuum is a \"dust buster\" for those who are familiar with it. therefore, it does not have the same powerful suction as an actual vacuum cleaner. that being said, it can clean up your vehicle well. the power cord is long enough to easily reach every inch of my dodge grand caravan minivan. if you do have difficulty reaching there is an extension hose you can connect. the vacuum comes with two different adapter tips to help clean in hard to reach areas. my favorite adapter is the brush, because it can pick up more than the suction alone. when you are finished using the vacuum you can press the button on top that releases the large end piece with the filter. pull the filter out and you are able to discard the contents. since this comes with a carrying case you can keep everything together and in your vehicle.overall, it performs as advertised and i am pleased with it's cleaning ability. i do wish there was more suction to clean more quickly and to remove pet hair easier. the suction alone hasn't been able to remove my dog's hair in the upholstery. when i add the brush attachment the brush pulls the hair out of the upholstery, but it remains in the bristles. thanks for watching,given sample to test and return my personal honest opinion. i create videos to demonstrate that i have tested the product and have made no false statements.\n",
      "ahhh, this thing is awesome, i have been wanting one of these for so long, i'm so excited to have it, i am a neat freak and like to keep my car perfectly clean. this is so convenient as it just plugs right into the cigarette lighter. it's lightweight, portable, and even has a cute little bag to store it in, and it is small enough to fit under my back seat, so it stays out of the way but close enough when i need it. this so beats dragging out the heavy vacuum and extension cord every time i need to clean my car. great product, a++\n",
      "this is a small sized light weight car vacuum cleaner. i needed it due to having two kids who love to eat in my car. then with all the sand, hair, and etc that happens. i plug it in and can clean the carpets and seats well enough. now i personally wish the suction was a bit better but it does well enough for me. it's nice to have this so i can clean up the car on weekends. i can't wait to use it this summer when we go to beach. that sand seems to get all over the car. i personally keep this in my car at all times. i never know when i might need to use it accidents do happen.\n",
      "my husband is so happy to have this i bought this for him for an early valentines gift. we have two sons thats always making a mess in his car dropping their snacks on the floor and soda omg too much messy. now my husband use this for easy cleaning of his car you dont need batteries since it is powered by the car with a lighter cord you just insert it into the cigarette lighter port. its is so easy that i am also happy that my husband likes it.\n",
      "small, lightweight but very functional for removing all the dirt from our car, it's very convenient to use even under the chairs that u can't barely reach. yeah, i totally agree with it's description it's not just elegant but it really works great. it cleans thoroughly every spot of my car. it comes with 14.6ft cable, long enough for your needs. and it has 3 different specific attachments. you don't need electricity to plug it in, you just plug it in the cigarrete car charger, and the suction really works well. for me, being skeptical is out of the equation. it's worth buying.\n",
      "this portable hand vacuum works great on spills and tidying up during a rest stop. the cord is long enough to reach to the very back of our minivan which was surprising. clean up is so simple. simply pop off the front cap, discard the debris and pop the cap back on. the filters are easy the clean too. just simple soap and water will do the trick. overall i am very pleased with this vacumm. it goes everywhere i go.\n",
      "this is a great car vacuum cleaner. my suburban was very dirty and it got it pretty clean. just like any car vacuum like this you do need to dump the trash out more often but it's not too bad. it comes with a little zip carry case, 2 filters, a extension hose, a brush attachment and the small attachment for cracks and smaller areas. it's very easy to put together and it simply works great,\n",
      "first car vacuum that i've ever had. i appreciate that it has an extra filter to change the other one if it's damaged or too old. it's really nice that it's not heavy and is not hard to use. thumbs up for the long chord though, i could reach my car's trunk. easy to use and i am happy that it has a bag to put it in. not hard to install the soft long tube, brush and crevice tube. i recommend this car vacuum cleaner if you like an easy work. my wife can also use it and she's happy that it is lightweight.\n",
      "this car vacuum cleaner was awesome .i really need this so badly for my husband ,yes all the description they provide is correct .when my husband got home from work he is surprise with this item .he said this is what im looking for  its very elegant ,easy to use ,handable and works great on our car .im happy i found this item ,very useful .the one thing i like it more all the accessories are complete .it comes with a kit bag and has great expensive quality.i recommend this to everyone .\n",
      "the best vacuum ever.i really like the concept of the handle easy to hold because it's a closed handle.work good and easy to used and assembled.with all the attachment this is one of the better car vacuum i've used and it's also really good because it's have a transportation bag were u can put all the stuff together,so it's not pulling apart in the car.\n",
      "i really, really love this car vacuum. not only is it super convenient, it works awesome. i have 3 children under 8, youngest is 2, and they make a lot of messed with snacks in my car. to be able to plug it in my lighter socket and clean my car is great. no more having to wait until next car wash to vacuum car out. it came with an extra filter as well.\n",
      "omg this came in handy as soon as i got it i had a car full of two years olds going to the park as soon as we leave they waste a whole bag of chips an a half gallon of juice an might i add i was uoset but i pluged up my vacuum an it cleaned it all up it didnt leave a crumb an it got the juice up as well its it great for moms on the go so your car will stay clean i fell in love\n",
      "i would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't because mine came without the extra filter.  this vacuum is great: i did not want a battery operated vacuum because they usually are less powerful and must be constantly recharged. this plugs into the cigarette lighter. you must have the car running to get it to its full speed. the chord is very long so it will reach everywhere in your vehicle.  the attachments are great and provide a variety of different configurations. i just like the brush on the tip. cleaning it is very easy too. one recommendation is to use an air compressor every once in a while to clean the hepa filter.\n",
      "this car vacuum cleaner, wet&dry portable handheld auto vacuum cleaner for car,16.4ft(5m)power cord with carry bag.  it is very powerful, you can get into tight places pretty easily.  it empties easily.  i like that is it wet and dry.  i give this product 5 stars.\n",
      "i have a messy car with crumbs and dirt. i could say it is all my 8 year old son's fault but its me too (ha ha). when i saw this i wanted to try it and see if it could help me keep my car clean. i have been testing it about 2 weeks and it works great. it has great suction and the attachments fit on good and work great too. i love that it has a carrying case that is easy to actually put all the stuff back in. it also says it is a wet/dry but i have only tested the dry. once i do test the wet i will update my review and let y'all know. otherwise i'm loving this product,if i discover any issues with the vacuum i will update this review with details and a new rating.\n",
      "upon receiving, i was very surprised at how tiny this vacuum was. but after my first use, i realized it was more powerful than i thought. it picked up the tiniest pieces of lint and dirt from my car floor. the cord was long enough to reach both the front and back seat. the vacuum comes with a convenient storage bag that fits the vacuum and all of its accessories. the vacuum is small enough that it can fit in your trunk and will hardly take up much space. the only drawback that comes to mind is that this vacuum can only be plugged into the cigarette lighter receptacle and not an actual outlet. so therefore i can not use it for anything else. i was hoping i could use it for my staircase as well but it looks like i will need to buy another separate handheld vacuum for that. but having it plug into the cigarette lighter receptacle will work perfect for when we go on vacation or road trips since our backseat gets so messy with children. this little vacuum will definitely come in handy and we don't have to look like slobs when we reach our destination. lol. overall i'm quite happy with my purchase. this vacuum is efficient and the price is decent.**i read reviews to help me make better buying decisions, so i'm committed to helping you in the same way. if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up so that others can learn from it and make up their mind about this product for themselves. thanks for reading,**\n",
      "this car cacuum cleaner i got is really nice because it is lightweight unlike my old one is heavy and i don't feel comfortable of using it. i like this so far and it works pretty good. not bad for the price. i highly recommend this.\n",

      "with the 3 kids in a corolla, we really needed something to keep in the car. this seems to get the biggest part of the job done, but it isn't what you'd need for fine cleaning.accessories: 3/5the accessories are cheaply made, but work decently with proper use. the hose extension broke when i let my 4 year old try to vacuum the car though. the brush attachment is nice and necessary if you'd like to get any bit of hair out of the car, but it only goes so far when the motor on the vacuum doesn't suck very much.function: 3/5the design of this has 2 major flaws.1. the motor is not very powerful. it provides light suction but will not pick up small leaves, small twigs or anything other than light dirty and  maybe some cracker crumbs.2. the dirt canister has no way to keep the debris inside. there's no flap or suction mechanism, it's just open and the idea is that the dirt will settle around the sides. this doesn't work once there's any amount of stuff inside of it and you have to empty is very frequently in order to keep from making a mess as you're cleaning one. however, this does not overheat like other vacuums, it didn't even get warm.value: 2/5right now it's listed at $35.00. for that price, you can easily pick up a black and decker. we got a shark petperfect ii refurbished for that price and it lasted for 2 years before the battery quit charging on us.honorable mentions:- bag: the carrying bag really is convenient and keeps all the attachments from getting lost. i think more brands should adopt a similar accessory.- 12v power option. it would be nice if more handheld vacuums had this or included it as an option because it's very inconvenient to run an extension cord out to the car or to be using a cordless vac and have it die before you're finished.overall:i wouldn't purchase this again. i know there's a lot of brands of the exact same vacuum floating around and their brand stamped on the front of it, but the design of it lets you know they're the same vacuum. for us, we need something with a better design and more power to get our car clean, not just slightly less dirty.\n",

      "you know how much of a pain it is to take the shop-vac out just to clean your car? this vacuum comes in handy. it's small and convenient and better yet, it's made with great quality. i'm definitely happy with this purchase. this car vacuum cleaner is definitely for me, little but powerful.\n",
      "* great design* light weight* easy to store, both in car and at home* easy to clean after use* really like the reusable filter - no need to purchase more* brush tip is very sturdy, which makes me feels like i am really cleaning the interior.* my only concern is that the suction power is not strong enough.  while vacuuming inside pockets on back of front seats, i had to grab a plastic piece by hand.  also, while accessories are handy, it is still hard to get into some places, such as between front seats and middle consul.this vacuum was the one with the strongest wattage on amazon.  perhaps i could have ended with a weaker one.\n",
      "this a great in between car wash vacuums.  i typically use a shopvac to clean my cars out but that can be a hassle as i need to get extension cords and lug the big vacuum out of the basement. of course this small vacuum doesn't have the same power as the shopvac but it does do a good job at cleaning up small messes. i like using this small vacuum to clean up small messes as it is very easy to use and i keep this in the trunk. the power cord is fairly long and allows me to reach every part of my car (4 door cts) without any problems. i have yet to test the wet function of the vacuum, but the dry vacuum works as intended and picks up almost everything in its path. i received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.\n",
      "i have an older bissell cordless handheld vacuum that worked fine for a few months before the battery stopped holding a charge. so when i received the hotor 12v corded model, i was very anxious to test it out to see how it compared to a name brand one.inside the easy to open cardboard packaging is the vacuum itself, instructions, cigarette power adapter, a brush attachment, crevice attachment, and an extension hose. visually, the vacuum looks very nice and modern. the smoked color plastic part removes easily to dump into the trash.the suction was just as good as my old bissell and since it is corded, i don’t have to worry about having to charge the battery. the charging cable is about 14 feet long so i am able to reach every part of my car, including the trunk. the crevice tool was able to remove a lot of crumbs from between my seat cushions and the brush removed hair that was stuck to my floor mats.overall, i am pleased with this vacuum from hotor. it is very lightweight and performs well. obviously it is not as powerful as my shop vac but for quick cleanup jobs, it does the trick perfectly.highly recommended, 5/5 stars.this product was provided as a sample for my review. these opinions are solely mine and are unbiased and honest and not influenced in any way by the seller.\n",
      "i have been looking for car vacuum and finally i got this car vacuum cleaner from hotor and really good compare with others that i had before.  the suction is strong enough for small car vacuum like that.  also, it is a wet vacuum and dry vacuum that has a long power cord can reach all around inside the car.  they come with a nice small bag with strap handle can that protect the vacuum from getting broken or lost small part.  this car vacuum is well made, the way they designed its very nice and the vacuum work great. this hotor dc 12 car vacuum cleaner wet and dry, i would recommend to anyone. great product .\n",
      "seller very quick to respond to questions l. fast shipping. nicely compact and comes with a carrying case that makes it easy to store. cord plugs into the cigarette jack of the car and is long enough to be able to reach all crevices. very effective on removing pet hair,, this was very important to me since i have two very large active dogs. i couldn't be happier- well worth the money,\n",
      "i store the vacuum in a hidden compartment in the trunk of my small suv. i think it suctions very well and it's easy to empty.  i really like it,, with a toddler who is always messing the car up, this little champ packs a punch. i'm very happy with my purchase,,edit to add: mine did not come with the extra filter as promised, so i did take away a star for misleading advertising.\n",
      "this vacuum is so awesome.in the past i have had troubles with handheld vacuums.it got to the point that i stopped buying them and they were name brands,i can see this becoming a name brand,it is powered with a car lighter plug adapter. i had no problem plugging it in and running it.the cord is super long so i am able to reach the back seat, the floorboards and even all the way in the back of my dodge nitro.i am also amazed at the suction power. it picked up small papers and pebbles and the finest dirt.remember it is a handheld so it does not have a huge dirt holder so if you have a really messy vehicle you will be needing to empty it quite a bit but it is totally worth it. it comes with two attachments, the longer hose adapter and piece that slides into it for pick up and the scrubber adapter.i love the storage bag to, now i can keep this in the back of my vehicle without it looking like an eyesore and i will always have it handy and ready to use in case of accidents.i have not tried sucking up anything wet with it yet, because thankfully there have been no spills, but i can honestly say it is worth it to have just for the dry pickup alone,i definitely recommend this to everyone, especially mothers, kids tend to track the worst mess into vehicles. this vacuum is a must have,\n",
      "i have a fairly new car and unlike my old heavily used mini-van, this one can continue to look new as long as i take good care of it. i like to use the car wash vacuums because they have such good suction. but in between visits, this is fairly good for quick touch ups. i really like the crevice tool because it gets in between the seats especially on the sides of the driver and passenger seats where all kinds of things fall down.the suction is moderate and it has a harder time getting things like dry grass out of the carpet. it is no comparison to a car wash vacuum but it does what you would think for a smaller hand-held. it runs off your car battery (convenient) and has a couple of attachments, an easy to clean collection area and a carry bag for all the parts. sample provided for review.\n",
      "i have been wanting a vacuum for my car for sometime i have tried two different ones from the department store and neither was really good. the car vacuum cleaner from  hotor  is remarkable compared to them.i am very pleased with how well it sucks up everything on the floor and seats you can imagine what i have on them with a two and five year old. it is a wet vac and a dry vac, has attachments and a long cord that i can even do my trunk with it.the storage bag keeps everything together and from getting broken, it has a nice strap for carrying as well. i received the vacuum, extension hose, brush, crevice attachment, a 16.4 inch  lighter cable, operation manual and carrying case.the vacuum is very well made, nicely designed, works wonderful and came nicely presented as well. i am very pleased and i recommend. i am providing my honest unbiased opinion based on my use.\n",

      "hotor deserves applause for presenting this new device that is what all car owners have book waiting for – a simple but powerful, self contained in a nice little kit, easy to use hand help car vacuum cleaner that allows for cleaning the car whenever it needs it instead of waiting to go to the carwash to pay a lot of money for a superficial job.the kit comes with a carrying case that holds the motor (12 volt 106 w 2800-3000pa) filter, four vacuum attachments that will allow cleaning of every part of the car’s interior, a cord that simply inserts into the cigarette lighter socket, the ability to do both wet and dry cleaning – and it all starts with simply a button push.it is difficult to appreciate this car vacuum without either seeing it perform or using yourself. the price is very reasonable for all the headaches it saves you. and to be able to quickly clean your car for those unexpected meetings or picking up family or friends or clients makes it now indispensible. highly recommended on every level. grady harp, july 16this product was sent gratis for an unbiased review.\n",

      "product tested and reviewer by kevin di used this vacuum and attempted to clean my vehicle with it. i use the word attempted because it wouldn't suck up very much, small pieces of leaves and sand was about as much as it could handle. it does come in a nice carrying bag with a variety of attachments and the reservoir that holds the dirt is easily detached and dumped and clicks back on. the vacuum looks well-built and its design allows for comfortable use. however, it still has the flaw of its lack of suction regardless of your vehicle is on or off. this product sucks, just not in the right way.discounted or complimentary product received for testing and unbiased review\n",
      "this vacuum is super convenient. you zip it up and store it in the trunk or under your seat. my car gets pretty dirty and this helped to clean it up in 5 minutes, the long cord is also super convenient. you can reach every space in your car.\n",
      "so far so good. picks up well for a quick mess. i carry this in my car because of my daughter. awesome and quick way to pick up crumbs and small mess. i would still stick to my vac for more extensive cleaning but for a quick clean up this is a superb choice. lots of power and cord reaches well. attachment come with it are nice ,\n",
      "i have 2009 jeep liberty. and the hotor did great job in cleaning everything. i was little skeptical at first when i pulled it out and seen how small it was very compact. it's  a great vacuum cleaner for any vehicle car. the cord reached to the back of vehicle with no problem at all. very powerful.\n",
      "very convenient to be able to keep a vacuum in your car. works well. plugs right into your car adapter. easy to use, it has a few accessories that make getting into hard to reach areas easier. i love the bag it comes with, it holds everything nicely.\n",
      "after a heat problwm occuered just by using it the first time . i asked here about the problem and how to solve it and the hotor team here were very helpful and very quick to answer my question and to solve my problem .recommended\n",
      "i usually spend most of my time in the car for eating or my boots get all dirty cause of the mud which transfers to my car. i never have time to vaccum thos just plugs in to the ports on your car and works its a great wet vac also it comes with and extra filter\n",
      "product arrived on time ??.ive used this just once so far. works well, looks great and love the bag that came with this vacuum. ????my only comment is, i wish this was chargeable. coz it was hard to get in tight spaces and worrying about the cord. but other than that. this product is good,, would recommend. im just hoping this last long. will update after a couple months of use.\n",
      "i like this mini vacuum. it's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.i find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. it has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. it pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. it's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. it's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a dirt devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.the brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.that said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. so while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.everything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.initially i did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. but it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. i found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. the filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (obviously, take the cone off the motor first). after that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.ultimately i like this thing. it's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. if you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. if you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.i was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.\n",
      "this tool is light-weight, durable, convenient and easy to store in the vehicle and use. i was pleasantly surprised at the high quality level of all aspects of the little portable vacuum.it plugs into the car cigarette lighter. after 15-20 minutes of being on continuously, the motor was not hot, actually.no heat at all.and that is surprising, all parts and attachments assemble together very easy, and all attachments stay together even during vigorous usage.the small brush easily gets between the seat and door posts where there’s not much room, even for a hand. it picked up everything off the carpet and off the floor mats. it has a brush attachment that really works, and a crevice tool attachment that works well in the seat crevices. it also has a hose attachment which works well and appears to be very durable.the front stays secured during usage and easily detaches for emptying the dirt out and then is easily re-attachable after emptying.  everything, including cord and attachments, easily goes into the carrying/storage bag when finished using.  the case is nylon and durable. i was happy to get this in exchange for an honest review.susan schenck, award-winning author of the live food factor and several other books\n",
      "i've always wanted one of these as i don't like having to bring out the garage vac to the car.pros:- small, easy to handle.- plugs into cigarette lighter which is easier for me than getting out an extension cord and plugging in a regular vac.- can vacuum small crevices. my family uses the side passenger pockets, the backseat pockets and the cigarette holder as trash containers. i was never able to vacuum the side pockets because the smallest attachments to my regular vacuum were always to big to get in. but this hotor vacuum has attachments that are small and slim enough to finally get those places for me.- fits into carry bag when done.- pretty flexible and i can reach anywhere.- easy to clean. one button push releases the dust compartment and i just empty into trash can.cons:- not very strong. it takes a long time to clean time to clean large areas like the floor.thoughts:we get all the usual compromises of small appliances. it's small and handy but is not for big jobs. overall, i would use this for small jobs, small clean ups and small spaces i can't reach with my garage vacuum.i received this product at a discounted price or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.\n",
      "this thing couldn't suck up the cash to pay for it at the dollar store.\n",
      "the moment i saw the words \"amphibious vacuum\" on the box i knew i was in trouble.so far i have used the vacuum once. the suction is weak. the dirt cup seems glued in - i wasn't  able to empty it out. and the zipper on the storage bag broke the first time i tried to close it. now that i think about it i should return it.i gave it 2 stars because despite it's cheapness it did get some crumbs which was better than nothing.\n",
      "compact vacuum cleaner. the best part is this can be powered by car charger. you can be driving and someone sitting in the back can be vacuuming seats, i am not sure if that is good  but can be done. fantastic one and you can keep major servicing once in 7 or 9 months. i was provided a sample for a discount in exchange of a review.\n",
      "i bought this vacuum so that i wouldn't have to get out the shop vac every time that i needed to clean the vehicles. i was surprised at it's performance and ease of cleaning the filter. my only gripe is the bag that came with it. it's cheap and the zipper broke after only one use.\n",
      "i wish it was slightly more powerful but i love the little case and attachments. i think it is great for in between cleanings but i will still probably use my shop vac for my thorough car cleanings.\n",
      "well, i am surprised.  completely and totally and pleasantly surprised.  yes, i am yet another reviewer who received this car vac for free from the seller because they needed folks to test this out and review it.  i agreed to test it but i was very skeptical.here's the thing.  my car is a dog car.  make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  they aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  when i bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  so, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac i just was not optimistic.it did a good job.  the suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  but when i was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  this picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  it struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  i used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  by the time i was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  i am impressed.  it could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  and the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  i am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  you wont have that problem with this vacuumbottom line:  is this the best vacuum i've ever used?  no, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  and it really does a very good job cleaning.  so small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.  it comes with a little carry bag which fits the vac perfectly and you can even fit the accessories in there.\n",
      "part of the vacuum was broken upon arrival. it was part of the front that kept it attached to the motor. i was able to still use it, but it was difficult.\n",
      "i just recieve last week but its broken\n",
      "i want to get a higher power with the same size.\n",
      "if i could rate this zero starts, i would.  i don't know who the good ratings came from but they must be fake or paid.  the suction is terrible.  this vacuum will barely suck up crumbs.  the cup holds very little before it starts to spill out the suction hole.  you have to empty it about every 30 seconds of use to avoid this.  just to do a quick once over on my car which wasn't hardly messy, i emptied the cup about 8 times.  also, the filter will not stay tight so a lot of dirt and dust goes around it.  complete waste of money,\n",
      "suction not as  strong as i hoped.\n",
      "so let me just start by explaining where this is lacking the 5th star.i recently just tested out another vacuum for hotor at the same price that i felt was an overall better vacuum.the case on this vacuum is too small in my opinion. i had no problem fitting everything in the other case but this one is way too tight of a fit.also they both seem to have about the same sucknig power but this one has less features (light, and tire pump)also this doesn't impact the 5th star but this vacuum came dirty, and the first thing i had to do was empty it out and clean it.my personal opinion is since this does less and the case is small i would recommend this being closer to $20 or $25 and then i think this could be a 5 star as the cheaper price would explain the less features and smaller bag.other than that it is a great vacuum to just keep handy in the back seat or the trunk.- strong suction: dc 12-volt 106w 2800-3000pa suction, it can pick up an iphone 6 easily let alone any busters in your car. a must-have for who is particular about his loved car.- multifunction: hotor dry&wet car vacuum comes with 3 serviceable attachments and a 16.4ft /5m power cord for you to help clean any hard-to-reach area. and liquid absorption is as easy as pie to it.- convenient storage & carry: comes with a zippered carrying case that houses the vacuum and all of the parts. this makes it easy to keep either in the garage or in the back of your car.- easy to wash: you are suggested to pull the filter out, discard the contents and give the filter a wash with the brush attachment included after every use to keep it new and last a longer life.- package includes: 1 x hotor handheld car vacuum1 x extension hose1 x brush attachment1 x crevice attachment1 x 5 meters long lighter cable1 x operation manual and1 x carrying case.disclosure: this product was sent to me for review. however, it does not influence my rating. they welcome positive as well as negative reviews.\n",
      "met my needs for car vac.\n",
      "i was a little hesitant reading the reviews buying this. but, this works awesome, i use it to vacuum my minivan every saturday. i have young kids and it picks everything up and it's easy to dump.\n",

      "this is a great addition for my truck. the vacuum is very strong . this is a very handy device and will be buying more of these for my other trucks.my fleet will at least have the cleanest interiors around.\n",
      "first let me start off letting you know that i received a dirt devil car vacuum cleaner (same design as this one), that completely sucked (but not anything up), then i tried a black and decker completely cordless vacuum and it was around $70, and i returned it because i charged it for 5 hours and it worked in my car for about 30 minutes, and that's being generous. this little puppy right here, had \"poptable car vacuum,\" on the front when it came in, so i was a little skeptical because i thought it was supposed to say portable. plugged this baby in and it worked better than both name-brand vacs. applaud.\n",
      "package arrived quickly and was packaged with care. product is very well constructed and built very durable.it is portable and easy to maintain.package:1 *120w car vacuum cleaner1 * brush1 * eva soft tube1 * hard crevice2 * hose connectors1 * user manualthis is a great little car vacuum. it gets into all those hard to reach places and it has excellent suction. it surprised me at how much it can do and how strong the suction really is. it vacuums up wet and dry debris with no problem. i love it because i do not have to do all the back bending acrobatic positions just to get a really nice clean car.\n",
      "got this car cleaner from one of my friend, great gadget to clean the interior for car. built with a great design, holds firm and easy to use. i used to have a similar cleaner but that one burned after working for a long time forgot to turn down. so i think the motor for this kind of handheld car vacuum cleaner may easy to burn out, i don't know how long this motor can last, but it works well till now because i always turn it down after 15-20 minutes usage so the motor can cool down better.\n",
      "this car vacuum cleaner blew me away, it is not heavy or bulky at all, i sort of expected it to weight more than it did, the hose is just the right length and easily gets to hard to reach spots (where my toddler tends to drop cereal and other snacks).it comes apart easily to empty and clean out, it does run via the cigarette lighter or adapter plug in your vehicle, so if you don't have one you may need to buy a converter to run it with a extension cord.this works so much better than my bulky shop vac i had been using, i have issues with my hands and this is extremely easy for me to use. it makes quick work of even the toughest messes my toddler makes in the back seat,\n",
      "i happened to get a similar vacuum cleaner as a holiday gift, i did not expect it to work like a home cleaner but it works well till today. it is not a problem for it to suck small things like hair, granular objects, dandruff, small stones, water and etc. a good essentials to keep in car. well, if you wanna use it at home, you may need to get a charger with a car cigarette lighter port to get it power on.\n",
      "lightweight and fits anywhere picks up all the junk the kids drop all over the car.  it's a good lengt cord reaches all the way in the back seat.\n",
